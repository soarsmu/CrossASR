mr president i think it is the wrong way of going about things to use this report as a political response in the öcalan affair
the commission has now concluded that greece fulfill all the convergence criteria

the question rightly mentions three problem areas
member of the commission mr president the commission takes note of the decision of parliament to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution accompanying mr cashmans report until the next parliamentary term
– mr president it is highly immoral to force member states to provide funding for what they consider to be unethical
i believe that there is an opportunity to renew our relations now
for the act countries we have the money promised for the ninth european development fund and for the rest of the world we also have as part of the financial perspective clarity and certainty as to the budget level for development cooperation
the first is to improve the operation of the funds themselves and to prepare the union for the great challenges which await it and which we all now know by heart expansion the reform of the cap policies on the environment policies on employment the training and movement of young people and the fight against this centurys ills such as cancer aids drugs including the new sickness that of trying to legalize drugs
firstly of course i have to thank mr papastamkos but i would like to include in that expression of gratitude mr more sánchez a member of my own group and its shadow rapporteur
it is therefore important that relations be established with the interim council we must act as contacts in order to make it clear in this way that we are setting other elements in motion
that is therefore the reason why institutional reforms are increasingly unavoidable whatever their merit
this is also one of the aims of the commission communication i intend to present as soon as possible on structuring and employment
this assertion is completely groundless it is not a legal justification
here it is important that in future gap growth does not remain the only key indicator of social progress

mr president i was in bosniaherzegovina recently and saw the successful start of for the eu peacekeeping mission
i believe however that we are all responsible for this tragedy
therefore it is time to suspend this agreement because of not only the human rights abuses associated with the settlements but also those associated with the new apartheid wall which has nothing to do with security and everything to do with an illegal land grab

i also believe that parliamentary salaries must continue to be commensurate with the standard of living in the country of origin and with the salaries paid to those who sit in the national parliaments

in the european union where consumers are becoming increasingly environmentally conscious we can ensure that the timber we import from ghana is fully certified as clean

they are a challenge to us all
madam president i am pleased to open this debate on the proposal on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy which complements the water framework directive which is the centrepiece of water protection for the european union
the reason for this was not only because the principles of environmental protection and the rules for awarding public tenders had been violated but above all because a fundamental human right had been fringed by this i mean the right to property and moreover the right to property of people whose circumstances were frequently very modest and who wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of their lives in the small homes they had built for themselves
high levels of unemployment and low wages have once again prompted ordinary people to give vent to their displeasure in protest actions this time in uzbekistan

at the same time we ought to be using our influence with other middle eastern states not least iran and syria to get them to use their influence with fundamentalist groups in the middle east to support the peace process and not undermine it because ultimately the victims of any efforts to undermine the peace process will be the palestinians
i am also member of the committee on foreign affairs a number of years ago we adopted a solid report with a view to adopting a european external policy in the area of energy

voluntary cooperation is therefore no longer enough and in our view an organizational structure at community level is now necessary
the inclusion in a negotiated agreement of the fundamental provisions of the treaty concerning energy and the transit protocol is dealt with as well
as regards the called embargo mentioned earlier for the turkish cypriots and which never existed on the greek chariot side we believe that our turkish chariot fellow countrymen who for us are equally european citizens with all the rights which derive from the integration of chorus into the european union certainly need to be strengthened economically
closer trade cooperation between latin america and the european union would facilitate the implementation of economic and social cohesion policies aimed at promoting economic development and prosperity in both regions
the pillar structure is at the end of the day a totally useless construction for establishing openness

i want to dissociate myself from demands such as that we should cut my country s delegation in the european parliament by one third
commissioner ladies and gentlemen this in fact concerns a very serious episode which is a sign of an extremely farreaching situation as my fellow members have already pointed out and as the text of the resolution makes clear
with that in mind there should be close scrutiny of the actual role played by the eu in mr kabilas installation
as a sign of those countries solidarity with us the flags of lithuania of urine of poland of russia of estonia of azerbaijan and of georgia were also flown
but they must have a choice a chance to choose because it is well known that irradiation destroy vitamins

it is the stages that we are dealing with here
we can no longer allow such confusion and suspicion to surround immunization campaigns
i agree with the rapporteur that the joint undertaking is still in a startups period and therefore understand the relatively low utilization rate for payment appropriations
unfortunately this is a contrast the commission constantly has to cope with

there is also the possibility of working hours being annualised
indeed we can no longer regard environmental policy as a sectoral policy

i would also point out that in some very poor areas with a high level of delinquency such as the province of camera tobacco succeeds in literally keeping three zero workers off the deadline and these jobs would be placed in extreme jeopardy
i therefore hope that parliament will support the proposal
we are no longer talking about its chances or viability because the predictions are that in may a very broad and stable group of member states will be members of monetary union instead we are talking about specific matters and the three reports by mr arrow mrs forces marques and mr wolf deal with specific aspects of its application

the work is therefore financially undervalued and is often not considered to be normal employment under labour law as a result of which workers are exposed to unauthorized and unfair treatment the work is very often undeclared and workers who come from rural areas or from abroad have low qualifications do not know their rights and become vulnerable individuals

that can be done on the basis of the price of raw materials on the international markets
it is ruled by a dictator who seems his own power and privileges more important than the lack of stability of his country and the suffering of his own people

i believe that when deciding on this sitting the conference of presidents did not take account of the fact that the each joint parliamentary assembly would be meeting in vienna on the same day and that seventy eight members of this house will not therefore be able to attend one of the two events either the extraordinary sitting being scheduled or the plenary sitting of the joint assembly which we are obliged to attend
i do not think that anyone in this house feels that quotas are a positive thing but they are perhaps a necessary stage in the process not because men do not acknowledge women s competence but because positions that women deserve to hold have for a long time been occupied by men

the proper response to this digital divide is integration into the other european instruments

mr president the reason why we have again today been discussing humanitarian aid for refugees from the western sahara is that their homeland was not decolonised in the way planned by the united nations as long ago as nineteen sixty five but has instead been occupied for over thirty years by its neighbor morocco
as regards humanitarian aid i see that having shown its fighting spirit in the face of the echo scandal the european parliament is once again satisfied with explanations and a mere letter however madam president we have still not and i repeat still not received the clay report that sparked the whole affair

it is important that us relations are stepped up particularly in terms of trade and that they take account of both shared values and contrasting positions alike on which a constructive dialogue needs to be developed overall i have a positive opinion of the joint motion for a resolution and therefore i shall vote in its favour in the hope that it provides an impulse for increasing cooperation between these two important players in world politics and economics
one of the things we have to be constantly on the lookout for is giving people a fair deal and making it possible for them to play a full part in the community as full a part as any of us
… there are three main objectives for eu energy policy security of supply competitiveness and environmental
rapporteur p t mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i have been given the delicate task of presenting the report by elisa damião who is ill and therefore cannot be here today although she has been lucid and clearminded enough to follow every step of this report which quite rightly therefore bears her name
turning to the human factor this is crucial
el madam president the report describes in the nearest and most revelatory manner the nature of the european union as an imperialist union of european monopolies which is being militarism
i believe this to be an aberration only holding talks even with the people around mr maskhadov will lead to a genuine solution
but it is important as others have already said and welcome that russia is playing an important part in the diplomacy and time remains of the essence
i welcome the integrated approach of the commission
the commission scrutinized carefully the law made some proposals and all these proposals were adopted
that cannot be what you want
mr president the directive on endoflife vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in europe
the palestinian civilians are more subjugate than ever before and do not have any future prospects
is it not a scandal that there are still european companies which are reliant on child labour in india and other countries what are we doing to tackle this
in the process of drafting the report i mentioned time and again the various specialties of the new member states which will have to be taken into account when regulations are drawn up
and finally there are the crossborder aspects i shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points
we wish to ensure that article one of the directive promotes the sustainable efficient fair and considerate use of water
so the commission s decision on eligible regions for belgium denmark the netherlands and finland was taken on twenty six october
mr president the events in nigeria have been extremely serious
i am convinced that the various parties represented here and certainly this applies to my own group would be prepared to convert these dead letters into a living project
i can therefore answer positively that this is something of what we want to aim for
i want to use my limited time to talk politically about the process that we are going through
todays double standards will give rise to even more problems in the future
that is why we must reflect on how we can guarantee macedonian security again with forces from europe and in that context i can only recommend that you look at the past
i struggle to think who could match their knowledge and expertise
i am sorry in particular because the two spanish initiatives seek to include improvements in the current version of the sis that must necessarily reflect the longer aims of visit and consequently must be considered to be an integral part of the process of transition from sisi to visit
the commission proposal at least gives us the chance to use this years budget the two thousand and two budget and that would be a better solution for taxpayers to make sure that we are using money from this year rather than getting supplementary own resources for next year
we cannot allow the institutions in particular the european parliament and olaf to impede one another investigations
but we in europe must defend the principle of the family farm and must not allow others in the rest of the world to import into our area food that does not meet our standards
p l madam president there are around sixty zero m s sufferers in poland which ranks poland in third place after germany and the united kingdom
the horizontal and framework character of the directive is unfortunately violated by the exemptions from the scope of the directive and variations regarding the rights of certain specific population groups
you have done a great service to mr bloom because it was you who put the questions to him and gave him the opportunity to take the grandstand here
it is important to strengthen union rights at all levels such as freedom of association the right of collective bargaining and the right to strike
there are two points i should like to single out from what the council presidency said i hope that you will succeed in creating a flexible structure for the budget in the agricultural sector and i wish you every success in your efforts to do so
madam president may i perhaps begin by saying – because it is something in which i take a very personal interest – that the council constantly argues for the unconditional preservation of all international standards of human rights and of humanitarian international law in the context – and particularly in the context – of the fight against terrorism
otherwise i have a genuine fear that the internal market that all capitals see as being of crucial importance will be subject to increasing and massive disruption
what is more they suffer from discrimination both in the host society and within their own community
regular and longer cooperation creates confidence and it can lead to ambitious partnerships and cooperation projects which bring benefits for business and universities alike in terms of research development and practice

certification systems will guarantee that consumer choice is in direct relation to the pricing of electricity
statistical information will be included in the report although some of the details still need to be finalist since interpreting statistical data is always an extremely complex task
a number of them have also reportedly been infected with aids this is no isolated incident
the same applies to the followed report forty eight pages in all to the european parliaments discharge decision for the nineteen ninety eight budget
in light of the positive experiences with capital injections and accelerated repayment of buildings which have produced major savings in recent years it would seem sensible to use a part of the appropriations available in the budget for an advance payment for the d four and d five buildings in two thousand and five
that will be the time to say more than was possible today in this cautious evaluation
i should like to thank the presidentinoffice for his response
i do not think that should happen because it contradicts the spirit of justice to try the one who carries out the crime but to ignore the one who initiates it
it could be revised in the future but for the moment that is how it is
the united states veto of a un security council resolution to this effect a vote from which moreover germany and the united kingdom obtained is deplorable
the procession was accompanied by unprecedented violence
we need competition in products and competition in systems
it seems to me however that confusion cannot be ascribed purely to the linguistic factor
the atlantic coastal regions were the worst affected with the storm flooding vast areas including residential areas causing serious human and material damage todays vote responds to the request by the french authorities for these regions to receive among other things european financial assistance for an extraordinary disaster mainly a natural one affecting the major part of its population with serious and lasting repercussions on living conditions and the economic stability of the region
however i should stress at this stage that the agreement reached on april at the transport council represents a delicate balance and a delicate compromise so that there is limited room for further changes in light of the decisions reached at that stage
our original intention was to sort out practical projects in order to restore public confidence in us
i believe they are all very important
the committee of inquiry has raised a number of questions which i shall attempt to answer
so any attempt to make out that my group because a majority of its members voted against the karamanou report is in some way opposed to balanced participation of men and women in the decisionmaking process any such attempt is certainly doomed to failure
the european parliament has been concerned by this for years and regularly publishes reports piously wishing for blessed egalitarian resolutions incredibly labyrinthine systems and hair factories as you will all appreciate
i am leaving parliament tomorrow this will be my last legislative report for the european parliament so please accept my sincere apologies if i am a little bit emotional tonight
in southern sera developments are more positive
i am very pleased to see commissioner bjerregaard return
any country which fails to provide safe and affordable food to its people and ensure a reasonable standard of living for its farmers is heading towards instability and food riots
i must congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work and in particular thank them for having incorporated two of my proposals
it certainly does that but i would ask you mr prod to state clearly before us that you do not intend to go back on the treaties of maastricht nice and amsterdam and that you share the views of the majority of the members of this house about what i have said
subject the maastricht i i treaty and the environmental guarantee
in spite of the fact that it is welcome that the northern dimension is applied to the baltic sea region with the aim of developing cooperation both within the region and also in the border region from the baltic sea towards the east and that efforts are being made to involve russia which is murmuring its understanding of western values it is time to take a good look at how seriously russia has taken the northern dimension itself and factors connected with it into account so far it is quite obvious that in the wider context of the region russia thinks predominantly of its own interests
that crash left six people dead and a dozen injured
why because the politicians of europe have failed to do so
this report will not only bring real benefits to real people across the eu but will show that by working together at eu level people can benefit individually wherever they may live and irrespective of their means
renewable energy has a high priority in our energy and climate policy in particular with regard to reducing our dependency on imported fossil fuels
however nothing could be further from the truth
that is primarily an issue of affordability
i believe that there are three areas in the hair crisis where we need to take action in the period ahead otherwise the efforts made so far risk being compromised
it also sets up points of single contact intended to offer assistance to service providers and in particular sees
the balance between freedom and security will therefore be a permanent element in our debate it was during the last partsession when we heard minister clarke and it will continue to be so in the future
mr president commissioner i would like to thank you for your detailed reply but i wish to add a remark and a question
speculations in shares are making electricity more expensive and we may well end up at some point being unable to afford our own water when higher prices are offered for it abroad but what is even more dangerous is the prospect of foreign workers and asylum seekers being seen as an answer to the low birth rate and as a means of securing our social provision to do which is to light the fuse on a powder keg and the first explosions can already be heard getting closer and closer
p t the souchet report is quite positive and warrants our support firstly because of the importance it attaches to the participation of fishermen and their professional associations in the field of research and information on the state of fish stocks given that fishermen are in favour of protecting the environment since these are amongst the first people to suffer from its impairment
since then the europhile british press particularly the national sunday newspaper the observer has made great capital over the recent tragic collision between the swiss and the russian airliners
this in my opinion is an urgent issue for the future
from the report i shall point out three things that the commission is taking its task as the guardian of the treaty seriously these days that there is a tendency towards a more open and faster processing of complaints but also that the number of complaints has fallen
i cannot deprive my constituents of their right to sue in their own courts
furthermore mixed up with it all is a proposal for paternity leave which under the legal basis does not even fall within the scope of the directive as the commissioner clearly stated right from the outset luckily paternity leave needs to be regulated in connection with the system for parental leave and not in connection with leave in the sense of recovering from pregnancy or childbirth
one of the greatest human catastrophes of our time is taking place in afghanistan
i therefore hope that this method of open coordination this detailed and exhaustive approximation of health needs but also social needs and the humanisation of the lives of the elderly and of these problems is extended in future communications
i am happy to say that this text is also acceptable to the commission so there has been excellent cooperation between the three institutions on this file
back in two thousand and seven the romanian banking association a member of the european payments council took on the role of support organization for joining the sea schemes
the second step is the production of flood maps and the third is the formulation of floodrisk management plans but only where these are absolutely necessary
here too then there are lots of opportunities for the future and scope for being imaginative
with specific regard to communications i feel that this is a good starting point and that we all agree upon its structure and substance the rapporteur mr van velvet has done some excellent work for which all thanks are due to him although we must be aware that any regulations we adopt today can by definition only be limited in time and are destined to become rapidly obsolete
chinas influence on african countries is a dangerous example of a totalitarian model and a corrupt market model devoid of any respect for individuals or human rights or any respect for the environment
the followed to culture two thousand will soon be studied and we shall make a statement on it
i would first like to congratulate mrs ţicău as it is her first report

the juxtaposition of twenty seven navels does not yet make for a great continental project
we will also make every effort to ensure that these proposals are presented according to the envisaged timetable to make this possible
if we can reach agreement on this point then i think we will have solved the problem
it is small and mediumsized enterprises that will be particularly hard hit by this initiative for they lack the organization and funding to cope with such mandatory storage
de mr president commissioner over the past few months i have very frequently been asked why we actually need a directive
i should mention that last year this parliament stated that there was incontrovertible proof of terrorist acts by hizbollah and by a very large majority of its members called on the council to adopt whatever measures were necessary to put an end to the activities
i agree with you entirely mr presidentinoffice of the council that use of the flexibility instrument for administrative expenditure should be out of the question
in particular i am happy to see that the parliament supports the commission with regard to the overall budgetary envelope of the programmer
in order to facilitate an agreement within the into on this point we are holding parallel discussions with the united states and with the developing countries
the new provisions for on the spot controls give clay the ability to start investigations on its own initiative
amendments nos one hundred and eighty nine to one hundred and ninety three on the wetlands are designed to maintain a buffer water capacity which is essential in order to prevent floods and drought
i vividly remember the positive response of czech citizens to the practical financial assistance provided by the eu following the floods that hit our country
it is not acceptable and in this regard i am pleased that at the last minute we achieved success here for every individual member state to have its own national list of what constitutes a safe third country
it is more expensive to change a eurozone currency now than it was in nineteen ninety eight
we need some new elements
the possibility of holding an intergovernmental conference now or at some point in the future could be discussed
it offers me valuable support and advice whilst fully respecting my duty as ombudsman of impartiality and independence
my thanks to the rapporteur because this really was a good compromise on a very contentious issue
i have the impression that this freedom of choice is being boycotted for purely ideological feminist reasons which do not serve womens best interests
numerous sri lankans who had been displaced by the violence in their country have returned to their homes following the end of hostilities
the european parliament plays a substantial role in fundamental rights and therefore special consideration should be given to it when determining the agencys structures so as to strengthen the legitimacy of the latter
a parliament represents the people
the first point relates to the budget classification because it seems to the commission contrary to established doctrine on the nature of fisheries agreements the second relates to consultation of the european parliament prior to the start of the negotiations
mr president i consider that the request can be granted because i do not see any reason to refuse it
of course one also needs to rest and i think this must be a goal of a directive concerning the field of labour and health protection
i agree with the presidentinoffice of the council and also with the previous speaker that the best form of commemoration is when we also think about the future
the way in which the accession negotiations with turkey are being rammed down the european throat despite their lack of any democratic legitimacy whatever is a case in point
it deplores these incidents between neighboring countries and shares the anxiety expressed
madam president ladies and gentlemen the summit that brought the luxembourg presidency to a close did not yield the success for which most of us in this house had hoped
people would be required to report on each other on privacy matters the lives of these people will be endangered
i believe that these observatories create a handful of jobs for officials but that they do not create any jobs in small and mediumsized enterprises
developing countries that are in crisis are a good reason to call for more attention to be paid to the food shortage and its relationship with trade
some of you may be aware that plastic material is increasingly being used across the motor industry and this uniform test standard will allow designers to concentrate on meeting one single standard instead of having to divert their efforts to meet a whole range of different standards
we are postponing our vote but what are you doing
the earliest the debate can take place is twenty four hours after it has been announced the earliest valid time to vote according to the rules of procedure is forty eight hours after the start of the debate
the nature of the task which lies ahead of us has become clear to me the council has not done this task justice in the past
it is not simply to please and to satisfy the poor little european union
one of the points about this particular package is how we improve that and make sure that all member states are operating to the same high standard
this is the real way to avoid a similar situation to the one we have now
is work being done on one and when will it be produced
international financial activity on the currency markets has in fact decreased to around us one two hundred billion a day and that is due to the creation of the monetary union which is of course one of the levers of the flows of capital that are quantitatively scarcely manageable
he called for a global ban on called naked body scanners
the fact that for example weapons exist which are capable of destroying the whole world does not mean that we will allow them to be used
they have forgotten the language that the voters can hear and speak the language of institutions instead

you observed that the agreement between to and the european union has now come into being thus leaving the way open for the next european defence policy measures which we can expect to be taken in bosniaherzegovina
moreover this approach is in line with the commissions original proposal
poor countries and particularly the poor population of those countries do not benefit from worldwide prosperity
the vision of europe which we impart must be a vision which safeguards all the rights of the nations which accede at a later date be they cultural economic or social
but that constitution it seems necessary periodically to remind this house was rejected at the ballot box
we want to open up the market for competition between airlines
the aging of the population and the demographic change it brings with it are regarded as a threat to the labour market and the eu knowledgebased economy its member states and regions

each one of us is probably carrying two or three batteries – in our phones in our watches in our car key fobs and maybe there are even one or two heart pacemakers in this chamber
i voted in favour of the report on the use of financial resources earmarked for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants
no national mandate can be compared with the mandate in the european parliament
i would like to make a couple of personal comments on this debate
secondly strong opposition should be mounted to the solutions proposed in the report whereby the eu as part of the to negotiations should unilaterally reduce agricultural payments and subsidies in order to obtain as it is put a reward in the form of additional profits from the trade in services this approach which has already been taken many times by the eu has led to a restriction of production and sometimes even to the elimination of many sectors of agricultural production within the european union which has significantly weakened food security for eu countries and in recent months has also led to a marked rise in the cost of agricultural raw materials
i think it is wrong for us in the eu to send european industry out onto the world market with leaden shoes while our american friends are in trainers in india
it is important that the parties continue to work towards this goal
social policy is a national matter
it was with great regret that i received information that this debate had not found a place on the order of business and would not be the subject of discussion
they are funded from within europe
despite this figure i believe it essential that the principles of economy efficiency and effectiveness be applied it is in budgetary implementation above all that savings need to be promoted and incentivised
de mr president ladies and gentlemen i agree with mrs de palace that without european parties there will be no european democracy
at the heart of this debate is nothing less than responsibility it is about morals and ethics
women working in health care outnumber men but are underrepresented in health care decisionmaking
they are designed to help a huge range of people and involve research prevention and control in the case of avian influenza the method of providing financial assistance to cover costs incurred in taking the necessary veterinary measures needs to be updated
let us not accept the addition of new types of competition between workers on top of those introduced by the appalling bolkestein directive
all the regions of europe should play to their strengths i will go in a couple of weeks time to debrecen in hungary to the week of innovative regions of europe conference where all the regions will come together to talk about the concept of smart specialization
these elements formed an important part of the discussions we held
it cannot always assure the legality and regularity of underlying transactions as provided in the treaty
it does have a purpose
these meetings resulted in various concrete initiatives which will be endorsed by leaders at the summit itself
we must consider the consequences and provide the means
it is much better and that is why we are working with the tunisian authorities and italy in order to see how we can support italy to create jobs and growth for these people to find a future in tunisia because they are not refugees
mr president what happened just now is completely unacceptable
the european union should be giving particular support to the development of the transport infrastructure and its interconnection with the main european transport routes in the countries which have joined the eu in recent years
how can we forget that countries like malta or the small islands of the canaries or lampedusa cannot deal with the ongoing flow of illegal immigrants by themselves
i would ask the commission at least to stand by its own measures and directives including those for air quality
we hope that this latest position statement will yield more results
because the fact is that it makes no sense to have common rules on the curvature of a cucumber or the size of strawberries what makes no sense is to turn standards into binding legislation instead of just an option for those who wish to trade across frontiers
however in my view we need to make greater progress on the institutional problem because that is what the institutions image hinges on as far as the european citizens are concerned
firstly mr verandas wish that parliament be kept well informed about progress in our relationship with the united nations family and that this be included in our annual report i agree completely
nevertheless commissioner though i am happy about the signature of this agreement i feel i must criticism the slowness and delays with which the procedure has been applied in this case
if the signals from the market are that there is a growing need for this product it would be appropriate to allow higher quotas for the countries requesting an increase
i should like to ask the commissioner whether within his own area of competence he has brought forward any codes of best practice which should be copied by the member states or by small and mediumsized enterprises in particular when we consider that in its final resolution the vienna council placed particular emphasis on helping small and mediumsized enterprises for the hangover in the year two thousand
the aim however is always the same namely either not to let these substances enter water at all in future or only to let them enter water in weak concentrations
and the eu says it wants to help the third world

to cite just a few examples the em met with representatives of european unionwide banking and financial associations to discuss issues such as the replacement of contract prices that may become meaningless after the start of stage three and interbank rates
now when it comes to the google book search project the commission sees the google initiative as a demonstration that new business models are evolving to provide almost instant access to vast numbers of works to an increasing number of consumers
the council shares the concerns expressed by the honorable member regarding the political situation in bears and has made these concerns known to the belarussian authorities
fairness should therefore be the rule for all starting within the european union
i had meetings with many ministers and officials during which i raised the matters which the european parliament has been preoccupied with for so long including the question of human rights the status of religious freedom the problems in tibet the rancher lama the orphanages but also those more positive aspects relating to the new economic policy in china
i am critical of this attitude of resignation
it was not physically possible to do more than this because given the conditions noted by some of you it was completely impossible to send the necessary staff to distribute the aid
i talk of textiles and clothing products but also all sectors where europe has export interests
the up has become a symbol of patriotism yet during the second world war it gained notoriety for murdering poles jews and russians this getting provision is an attack against national minorities in urine the majority of whom are poles
i am happy to support the one that has been submitted to plenary
the national authorities currently comply with and ensure compliance with the requirements in force on civil aviation arising from international agreements
thank you very much and the same to you mr hökmark
regarding the legal issue i shall invite the services to prepare a note for whoever is in the chair at the sitting on thursday when the debate takes place so that they are able to deal with the questions which have been raised as to whether or not there is a legal question of admissibility
excluding planned development that is clearly linked to the project in geographical or other terms can only undermine the legal situation
consequently the first stage in the application of the action plan which is to be developed between two thousand and four and two thousand and five will concentrate on putting the necessary conditions in place for promoting the employment of people with disabilities
we are right to accept the reports differentiation criteria for compensation from which we can indirectly see the size of the company thereby ensuring that the viability of small companies is not jeopardize
it is very clear what they are saying
these provisions make it easier for the member states to use these facilities but they do not oblige them to use them
logging in african countries is often carried out illegally which impacts very heavily on the protection of producer countries natural resources as well as being an attack on biodiversity and on the quality of peoples lives and their future prospects
energy policy must not become a part of environment policy since in that case the two other objectives of energy policy namely security of supply and price competition will be made subordinate to the environment objective and of course we do not want that
i do not think anyone doubts that the development of the european economic fabric over the next few years will above all depend on small and mediumsized enterprises rather than large ones so greater attention must be paid to that sector with appropriate support
some claim that the european parliament should be judged by the same stringent measures as the european commission i do not share this view
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution tabled by the following members
in these difficult times our primary aim must be as this joint resolution says to protect eu citizens whether workers entrepreneurs householders from the effects of the crisis
as a partial excuse for this dearth of proposals there is also the ongoing revision of the common organization of some important markets such as tobacco olive oil meat and soon we hope milk
other colleagues too have referred to this matter
fi mr president gaze and the middle east situation was last discussed at the meeting of the general affairs and external relations council held yesterday at that meeting conclusions on this situation were adopted
– mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the report on equality between men and women in the eu sets out the progress that has been made on gender equality but concludes that much remains to be done if we are to end all forms of discrimination and if women are to enjoy a level playing field with men in both public and private life
that path was not followed such is democracy and today we therefore have to draw the political and institutional conclusions of mr böges report
fishing is very different from other occupations
do not fight globalisation join it by encouraging competition within the eu and learn how to compete on world markets
the european institutions should follow the example of a number of countries most notably the united kingdom and institute a committee for standards in public life with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the european institutions
here again i agree with most of your proposals and in particular the establishment by local fishermen of coastal management plans the harmonization of data on coastal fisheries the improvement of training for men and women involved in this type of fishing better coordination of all aspects affecting coastal areas and fishermen the improvement of vessel safety and of the safety culture for those involved the need to recognize the role of women and improve their legal work status and last but not least the better involvement of coastal fisheries in decisionmaking and representatives bodies such as the race
the eu will increase its assistance to east jerusalem to ease the living conditions of the palestinians
in writing l t the eu and the us have many points of contact and are playing a dominant role in solving global problems
böge and rothbehrendt report a four million, eight thousand, three hundred and ninety nine
seen in such a context the situation really is unthinkable and i should like to say to those many members of this house who are critical of the sections of the commission that have remained unchanged that by voting and by giving a blank cheque in doing so you will undermine your criticism
this gives phenomenal flexibility for individuals and firms in the planning of working time
as i have said before i believe it is particularly crucial to allocate necessary funds so that small and mediumsized enterprises which are among the main victims of the crisis have support that enables them to survive this crisis
again we need clear guidelines on how this can be operationalised
however those in favour of a european multicultural state have discovered that there is no european public opinion
the failures of the commission have been there for a long time
i am sorry that some additional amendments have been tabled because we should cling to the consensus that is within the report
the european union calls throughout the world for freedom of movement for capital
do we want to reduce the number of poor people in europe which currently stands at eighty four million
however i am under the impression that many pensioners prefer to use saccharine
without wishing to correct anyone here i shall simply remind you all that this is question time which has its own rules and ask you to adhere to the rules of procedure
it is very important to restore consumer confidence and i would therefore urge the member states and the commission to act quickly with the aim of introducing the system at the end of this year
de mr president i believe that we can all learn lessons from the situation in japan
that is why we see it as important that massive pressure should be brought to bear on the states bordering this country of great lakes and especially on wanna in order that it may bring stability once and for all and may be deferred from active intervention in congo which is already suffering so much
the results have been achieved thanks to the decisive actions of the law enforcement agencies which mustered all legal crime detection methods
fourteen amendment of the rules following the establishment of a common transparency register
i would say mr president that the adoption of this text will be a success
the ratio between coupled and coupled aid remains at three thousand, five hundred and sixty five
and this consensus has been reached not just in parliament but at interinstitutional level which means that as soon as possible and for the next three years we will have a renewed legal basis for implementing this policy
subsidies are directed above all to agricultural concerns and large intensive farms one hundred and thirty nine of beneficiaries receive almost thirty of subsidies
these problems are not limited to security and relate to food health and education
we have fortunately moved on from that but where the prosecution of waste crime is concerned we have not yet emerged from noahs ark and that madam presidentinoffice is something you must not be content with
indeed it is essential particularly for the new countries that the budget be adopted as soon as possible since otherwise we cannot properly draft our own budget programmes for the successful securing of finances from european funds
however in view of the globally interconnected markets close cooperation in connection with all regulatory measures if only to prevent various different standards from being applied is imperative
we have made a great deal of progress as a result of call and at the end of this year the commission will present a new communication to parliament and the council setting out the final stages for the achievement of call
my main thought here is that the member states do not owe it to the european commission or the european parliament to transpose the rules of the internal market but first and foremost to themselves and to each other and above all to their own citizens and their own businesses
poverty among women is directly linked to their lack of economic independence the latter must be stimulated by means of paid work that generates a sustainable income for women themselves and for their defendants
for many years attempts have been made to encourage the production of phosphatefree detergents
they are in favour of this solution hence my recommendation commissioner i urge the commission to rethink its position
that is why i entirely agree with the e p rapporteur the european postal system should only be mineralized to the extent that this benefits all consumers without jeopardizing the universal service
will the commission accept gap as one of the extra qualifying criteria for objective two
i believe that we need a balanced package which also of course takes account of transport but it should not be as exclusive as the commission has proposed
naturally it is also essential to work with excellent fishing gear here to fish selectively and to respect closed seasons
in this report we wish to acknowledge and maintain individual responsibilities in order to create a sustainable and safe system that is capable of ensuring an adequate pension at member state level
hence our groups appeal to discuss this once more with these new member states we shall certainly be doing this ourselves but this is also an appeal to the council and particularly to the commission not only commissioner fretting but also his colleagues
applause and laughter
increasingly of course we are all living in a continent of minorities
i give the floor to mr bangemann to answer mr andrewss question
at the very least this will cause us to suffer serious financial and social consequences and the competitiveness of some of our agricultural products will be damaged in relation to other countries that do not apply the same restrictions
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on culture and education el mr president i should like first of all to congratulate and thank the rapporteur mrs lévai on her excellent cooperation and the outcome of her important work in the report on collective copyright management
it mr president ladies and gentlemen i do not agree with what has been said about food prices rocking
this is the concept that i suggest
i therefore think that although this is a solid document there is something missing from the communication from the commission and in the report by mrs waddington namely the demand side
although i essentially agree with the report i reject its approach which is why i am voting against it
now we are pondering as to whether baroness ashton is capable of establishing a common foreign policy for the eu
nor must aid be granted to companies that having received aid in one member state transfer their operations to another without having fully met their commitments otherwise the aid they have received in the first country must be repaid
we have now come to a good compromise with the council which can be accepted after the first reading
i believe that we now have the chance to move ahead with romantic and we must do so
i would therefore like to end by making one more request what we need is not just good provisions on the individual measures but also at last to take an overall view of all the measures all the data that is transferred by the eu and the member states
preserving biodiversity is an important national objective the hungarian governments position on neglect of the nature two thousand sites is such that this week when we are celebrating the day of the land the central europe rally part of the dark series was organised unimpeded through areas of enhanced environmental protection and even through nature two thousand sites

however i myself and many others like me had hoped that we would have got further in respect of social matters and the third pillar
but the famine is very serious and we believe the commission should give full food aid to the people of north korea as a matter of urgency

i regard it as absolutely essential to strike a reasonable balance here with the proviso of course that the protection of consumers and the environment is guaranteed

in my opinion the difference between the views of the christian democrats and the greens on the one hand and the social democrats and liberals on the other hand is that the former emphasis the penal implications for the medical profession whilst the latter focus on the need for further research into the effects

all things considered this could be said to constitute a considerably greater environmental problem than the mining currently in operation
in the debate that took place in the committee on legal affairs and the internal market on this issue several amendments were tabled some were serious others less so in the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs the committee responsible baroness ludford made a sterling effort to attempt to refine and perfect the legal concepts but i am left with the impression that just because of the odd majority the text of the directive would be ruined if we were to adopt most of the amendments approved by this committee
before leaving the subject of the forthcoming convention i would like to focus for a moment on an issue that is usually summed up by one word the constitution
immunity is not a special privilege granted to us mess as individuals it exists to protect the work we do in the exercise of our parliamentary mandate
madam president some interesting things can be learned from the latest eurobarometer on biotechnology it appears for instance that the european citizen feels less optimistic about biotechnology whilst his knowledge of modern biotechnology has in fact increased

because above and beyond the interinstitutional powers which we are welcoming today in this compromise and in particular the increased role given to parliament we must clearly emphasis the strategic opportunity represented by this external action service which is an essential tool for equipping the eu with a more ambitious more consistent more credible and more effective common foreign and security policy
that is why we must press on together down this road in order to be able to build a europe in which we can all share
on plenary amendments we think that amendment nos sixty five and sixty six may send the wrong messages respectively by implying a reduction in wages and by suggesting a onesizefitsall approach

but the commissions proposals are prudent and pragmatic as they have to take account of the strong divergencies between the states divergencies which underline what the alleanza national has long maintained that a great europe is one where political union is the precursor of economic union political union should be and should have been refined before initiating the preaccession negotiations so that the new states could actually be presented with a precise and welldefined framework for the whole
however this is nothing more than a first step along a path where in my view we have three objectives to fulfill we must deepen the new member states integration we must dismantle those barriers which have introduced a twospeed europe and we must continue the process of the eus expansion towards the balkans
we share them with everyone on this earth
the eus data protection directive does not apply to state activities in the area of criminal law nor does a framework decision on data protection in police and judicial cooperation apply in this case given that no eu member state authority is involved in executing the us court order and that no personal data is transmitted or made available by the competent authority of another member state

madam president commissioners ladies and gentlemen the reform of the common fisheries policy has made some at times majestic waves of argument some of the arguments are reasonable and justified whereas others are hasty and disproportionate
if we want our territories to enjoy a form of economic development that comprehensively brings together preserving the countryside preserving the type of farming that is characteristic of a mountain region and developing tourism perhaps the commission should listen more carefully to two or three points that are absolutely crucial

however i can nevertheless confirm publicly here and now that implementation of the lisbon treaty would not impose on any member state any requirements with regard to issues such as abortion euthanasia and samesex marriages
and i would like to take this opportunity to say that we are concerned that the necessary ratification by member states of the european union will take another four years from now and the implementation of this euromediterranean agreement will thus be delayed even further
i will take another speaker in favour if there is a speaker in favour
as far as i can see it is this very lack of cooperation that has forced the committee on budgetary control to propose that discharge should be postponed and not so much the way funds have presumably been administered
it is also important for the commission to provide us with the draft directives we need to control private equity and hedge funds to ensure the transparency of credit rating agencies to keep managers salaries within reasonable limits and to close tax havens
there is a separate remark for the agency enlargement costs
today we are bringing about a substantial improvement for people sensitive to these children and the elderly
however mr president this is a sector in which we are talking about more than two million companies many of which are of course small and mediumsized enterprises providing almost ten million jobs a sector that is extremely labourintensive and in which human resources and the quality of these resources are fundamental aspects a sector that accounts for five of the european unions gross domestic product
in fact the commission is proposing to amend the nineteen ninety regulation by granting the pharmaceutical industry the possibility of using with provisional limit values drugs which are still at the clinical trial stage
that is why i believe that this report could help us not only to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy which is very important but also to provide concrete benefits for local communities which naturally means concrete benefits for the european public as a whole
in other words it is a package as was stated a moment ago
the fifth freedom will eliminate barriers to the free flow of knowledge
i believe that strong consumer organizations are extremely important for enabling people to participate and for giving them the opportunity to exercise influence
happily the agencys resources were indeed strengthened with the support in particular of our general rapporteur and spanish fellow members who helped us correct i do not know mrs wideroos whether to use the word stupidity or incoherence i shall opt for stupidity the stupidity of the council which had for its part reduced the resources of the fronted agency in spite of current circumstances
three different issues must not then be mixed up as has now happened
it refers to the same paragraph
in the meantime we have to be realistic about what we can achieve and at the moment we cannot talk about operational autonomy for any european force
if i may i should like to put a question to the commissioner in this connection what does the european union mean to us
the kurdish maps belonging to the deep are still being held in prison including the recipient of the sakharov prize leyla mana
but it is hard to accept that disabled sportspeople should be overlooked in this connection
the message conveyed by the european union on all these issues was absolutely unequivocal as you know we discussed sudan both in plenary and afterwards in a ministerial troika meeting
we cannot tolerate any scandal or mismanagement of expenditure
as i say i have sought to make clear on the floor of this house today the importance that we attach to finding agreement on future financing if we can at the december council
now the judges themselves intend to define what politicians can or cannot say
the aim is to encourage children to eat healthily by offering them free fruit
to close my request my plea to the commission is this please bundle all the initiatives which you have started in the internet sector into a single crosectoral initiative with a real overall conclusive concept
in particular the hydrological regime of the mediterranean and southern areas of the european union requires specific solutions in this respect without these and also without irrigation systems which often involve extremely high water storage and distribution costs it would be impossible to ensure the modernization and longer survival of these areas
these are the worries i wanted to share with you
by enlarging without is or but and with evergreater haste we are doing nobody any good on the contrary by dividing member states into two classes by means of derogations and alienation europes peoples we imperil that which has already been achieved
i believe that the report that was produced after the irish voted no to the referendum highlights a number of issues it raises questions of leadership thematic questions and highlights the lack of understanding of what the lisbon treaty actually is
at first i thought this was a mistake but the deeper we went into the bosnian state the more we saw of these huge posters
research projects would move abroad we would lose the huge amount of knowledge that we currently have and we would make ourselves completely dependent on other countries
we underline the need to maintain close contacts and support programmes for the development of civil society in russia
but i understand that you do not want to get involved
this is a vital part of a sustainable diet for europeans in the future
i am therefore prepared to work with you in an honest transparent and open way i am ready for this positive complicity with the european parliament but i must tell you that that will not be done to the detriment of the commission
i voted for the real report on the community strategic guidelines on the basis that it goes some way in attempting to inject a more social and environmental side to the commissions proposed strategic guidelines and because it supports sound partnership between all parties and the strengthening of civil society
i would also like to say to our portuguese colleague mario shares that i congratulate him because by taking part in this election he gave assembly the chance to contest the seat which is a sign of true politics and true democracy
in this context i believe that the incidents which italy has encountered in lampedusa highlight the need to devise an eu migration policy focused on the following areas
after that when he was special representative in kosovo and more recently during his extremely successful tenure as the un representative in east timor
it is a matter of power relations
pursuing the course of dialogue as mr submit pointed out is a good idea and i believe that is the course we should take but we must not forget that in the case of iran on one march the inspectors of the idea were denied access to the marching military complex and that at the same time the international atomic energy agency has confirmed that iran is building underground tunnels for storing atomic material and equipment nor that for its part north korea has between twenty and thirty kilos of plutonium at the nuclear reactor at yongbyon as well as one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world
however the new government must seize the opportunity of adopting a policy that no longer shuts out the outside world and that gives women democratic rights
in supporting the urban initiative let us not hear about duplication
we think that it could be used more often the other point is about a policy of granting subsidies to consumer defence organizations
the proposed transitional period until the year two thousand and six during which the authorities may apply an alternative set of capital charges for commodities represents a very sound compromise between the need to establish a common set of requirements for commodities business and the interests of individual institutions which would suffer unduly from an abrupt introduction of the new requirements
the facts are the total rejection by washington of the rome statute on the international criminal court the postponement by the united nations security council under united states pressure of any prosecution by the ice first until one july two thousand and three and then until two thousand and four or maybe two thousand and five and the bilateral agreement on immunity pursued by the united states with some foreign governments among them two european governments namely great britain and italy seeking for a law to protect american forces abroad a law that would authorize military action anywhere even in the netherlands to liberate any american personnel detained by the ice
this is a proposal designed to protect the vested interests of the eurozones existing central bankers they are just trying to pull the ladder up behind them
i am convinced commissioner that the commission will do everything it can to bring the negotiations to a close in two thousand and nine
mr president i believe that this house together with the commission and the council and every politician in europe is convinced that the protection of an individuals human rights is much more a fundamental duty in times of war and terrorism than it is in times of peace and security
in such matters an employer must show a great deal of flexibility
a few days earlier canadian inspectors had apparently boarded a spanish freezer trawler which was also fishing in international waters

political and budgetary balance needs to be created as soon as possible between the eastern and southern dimensions of the neighbourhood policy
europe is currently finding its competitiveness in global markets decreased
sorry we do not know whom we pay these to
in ten years the areas farmed in this way have increased tenfold organic agriculture is now a realistic alternative and a reliable one to intensive farming
i am of the view that parliament could play a more significant role in that compliance
most of these cases are dealt with by national central authorities inevitably i get the cases that have not worked out that way
however with their taxes our constituents cannot afford your generosity
we must consistently demand that the army immediately and unconditionally return power to the democratically elected government and we must use the available instruments namely sanctions to make it clear that what is currently happening in fiji is entirely unacceptable to us

if we had not found so satisfactory a solution to the problems with the endoflife vehicles directive we would not have been able to adopt this directive either because it would not have been evident why some were excluded from producer liability and others not

europe already costs a great deal
having listened to those who sell car insurance over the telephone amendment no thirty eight takes into account the fact that such a transaction must take place before the formal exchange of the durable contract
madam president ladies and gentlemen how then do we manage the future the conclusions of the european councils in nice and gothenburg gave a boost to the enlargement process
this will help to alter the current absurd and unfair situation where the amount of support can differ by up to a factor of as much as six thereby putting farmers from several member states in unequal circumstances and disturbing competition between european farmers
this is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication mr prod but which is unfortunately not there
already under the two thousand and three cap reform ninety of direct payments to farmers will no longer distort trade
the american presidents current negotiator robert zoellick wrote the nineteen ninety transatlantic declaration
however i will give you one example these reserves cannot be made available by for example all the policies or objectives relating to energy efficiency transport and so on being incorporated into the cohesion policy
you have to vote to change things and not just say you are going to do so
this is an uncertainty added to so many others hanging over the future of the european union such as those relating to integration deepening of the union and enlargement
it is especially difficult to define what human rights actually are and to agree on whether certain things are simply desirable or are really needed to correct abuses of the fundamental rights and freedoms set out in international conventions

safety is an important commodity especially for the most vulnerable amongst us
between thirteen and nineteen september some of us were visiting some of the poorest regions of the planet in the south of the african continent

what a shortsighted strategy on the part of the commission
– the next item is the proposal for a council regulation amending regulations exec no two hundred and seventy seven thousand, one hundred and seventy five and exec no two hundred and seventy seven thousand, seven hundred and seventy five as regards the application of exceptional market support measures avian sector com twenty million, sixty thousand, one hundred and fifty three – c six hundred and one million, one hundred and twelve thousand and six – twenty million, sixty thousand and fifty five cans
ladies and gentlemen these efforts must not be confined to raising the profile of your assembly
in relation to cohesion policy i am pleased to see that the committee has adopted my suggestion that structural funds earmarked for transport should have a greater focus on the general eu orientation of transport policy
that is the step that we are now trying to achieve by seventeen december so this is exactly along the lines of many remarks which i have made in the past
action must get under way immediately we cannot afford to waste time
such measures are currently covered only by into provisions these provisions are unfortunately outdated and need revision based on experience
you know that this subject is not on this agenda as it will be raised in the spring
mr harrison raised the point that we are punching below our weight
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen thank you for a constructive debate
investing in our children future is an investment in our own future
i know commissioner that it is not one that you favour but this is a social measure after all
i should also like to make another plea for something that the north sea commission fisheries partnership has already introduced namely letting biologists sail on fishing vessels
such a solution however would bring no advantage for the union since the use of one or another conversion coefficient does not influence community preference on the contrary it could be regarded as provocative by our trading partners and create unnecessary difficulties with third countries

the crisis is serious because it is primarily cumulative

some of the amendments provide necessary clarification particularly as regards responsibility during and after the exploitation of sites
the meetings of the conference that have been held to date have confirmed that there is broad consensus on most of the provisions drafted by the convention
i very much regret that these proposals were immediately shot down
i think the rapporteur has settled the case very well on our behalf and has been congratulated for so doing
that is why i would like to express my largest thanks to all who have cooperated in producing this acceptable compromise
this does result in a simple and transparent text it is true but it might not be effective in giving this assembly true powers of control over the legislative programmer control which obviously is one of the bases of our political activity as a parliament
i agree on the significance of the establishment of a european union mediterranean policy in barcelona in november nineteen ninety five under the spanish presidency
de madam president ladies and gentlemen i was very pleased with the outcome of the national referendum on twenty seven june
when they see their credibility collapsing and disintegrating the european union institutions resort ever more frequently to mendacious propaganda and to funding and imposing a single true vision of european unity

they only differ by four letters but that certainly makes a very big difference at the budgetary level
it is quite right to be unbending when it comes to certain important principles for that reason i am in favour of clawing back funds that have already been paid to the regions and member states if necessary unless important key principles relating to european union policy such as sustainable development equality nondiscrimination and the implementation of environmental legislation have been taken into account satisfactorily in the programmes
madam president one source of human exposure to pubs is through the food chain as the commissioner says
it is astonishing that society does not really recognize its own failure to harness the experience and potential of older generations
there are three facts i should mention by way of explanation for this running period first this report was the first of its kind
should they also join emu and schengen in polishing their borders

mistakes have without a doubt been made by interested parties on every side and when i say that we are paying bitterly for them now by we i mean above all else the palestinians but also or so i believe the israelis and all those with an interest in this region having for once something to look forward to not just a peaceful future but any kind of future at all
their health is therefore at risk nor do they call for the obligation for the european medicines agency to exercise total transparency with regard to its research and to the collusion between its officials and the pharmaceutical companies
the commission s proposal was made on fourteen may nineteen ninety six and is in line with the objective of extending the large cultural market to turkey too
working closely with the council of europe it will contribute to the necessary exchange of information and pooling of experience

so we can only be surprised at the size of the gaps between the member states of the european union which are emerging in particular from the first set of statistics published by eurostat last july
however mrs oomenruijtens report contains in the view of the french socialists an indication which poses us a problem and with which we will not be able to agree
we have prothermo as a basis but the commission should also carefully examine our proposals for calculating net electricity
please tell us
presidentinoffice of the council mr president i am very grateful to be here today and to have the opportunity to address the european parliament so soon after the positive result in the referendum in ireland
i would appeal to other states to do so
the peace implementation conference clearly indicated at the last ministerial meeting in london what results were to be achieved during this period
we shall be giving this aspect special attention but as i have already pointed out our measures to strengthen security must not come at the expense of freedoms and fundamental rights
however this pact has failed to work so far
the report welcomes positive changes implemented in the field of minority rights as a result of which the called legislation on antidiscrimination was adopted on january one two thousand and four
my fellow conservative and liberal members some of you want to punish automatically states that are heretics to your dogma to the tune of billions of errors
we trust that parliament will support our common mission
of course when talking about a smoking ban on an eu scale we must not forget the principle of subsidiary and we must allow the member states themselves to decide how they will defend and protect their citizens
mr president like mr andrews i speak this afternoon as one who regards himself as a friend of the arab and islamic world this resolution can only be supported if recital a and paragraph one are regarded as being at its absolute core
on this basis it is important to me as rapporteur that we establish a uniform level of animal protection in the eu
let us hope that it does not take five years
others are saying that we do not have a legal basis in the treaties
the states that have just failed out their banks ought to make it mandatory for them to pass on immediately the significant reductions to the ebbs base rate this would be a recovery measure that would cost national budgets nothing
the implementation of the proposals of the white paper on education and training in particular erasmus and apprenticeship and the pilot projects such as learning in the information society should contribute to promoting innovation and ensuring its image is democratize
the developing countries must respond to the financial efforts of the developed countries by combating corruption and acquiring firm democratic values

the regulation aims in the highlyinnovative and extremely important area of medicine production to protect all the patients who need those medical products and to do so by means of quality standards that are uniform across europe
the knowledge gained enables them to create better and more userfriendly legislation
that is why the contributions of mr titford and mr heatonharris are so misplaced they are aimed at alarming the british tabloids
having said that his report recognizes much that is a problem
instead environmental social and tax legislation must be sorted out in this house together with the council and the commission
i am happy with the result at least as regards the part for which i was responsible and where i had a grasp of the overall picture
this directive is worthy of our approval
with regard to price i entirely agree that we should move towards a system of incentives by means of insurance or other kinds of incentive that have already been put in place in other countries for the renewal of the fleet et
since then and especially since nineteen ninety seven when parliamentary elections were held and the new constitution came into force poland has demonstrated its commitment to reform
that represents a reduction of twenty four particularly large losses occurred in twenty million, eighty two thousand and nine
the main objective as also stated in paragraph eleven of the motion for a resolution is to enhance economic and social development
these weaknesses in the foundations of the internal market will be exposed even more strongly after enlargement
this is why we do not subscribe to this text and we have tabled our own far stronger motion for a resolution
in fact at present the situation of subdued economic growth and the stronger external value of the our make the structural reforms even more necessary
i would like to thank the commissioner for answering the question and i would like to say that we are of course looking forward to receiving more specific proposals regarding which initiatives are to be put into practice and i am delighted that this is taking place before the summer recess because i think it is important to follow up on this matter right now while we are discussing the our
thanks to the support for the main approaches and the broad convergence between parliament and the commission on all the measures i hope that the negotiations in barcelona will give us new impetus and that then as mr adam indicated earlier the negotiations between parliament the council and the commission will give full and total support to this regulated liberalisation in the electricity and gas sector key elements for the creation of the internal market and therefore for the competitiveness of the european economy
our thanks go to the prime minister of italy whose convictions it is evident are shared by the great majority in this house
first of all i would like to look at the common agricultural policy and rural development
the delegation was due to go to iran from eight hundred and ten january but that delegation visit was cancelled
secondly we should remember that we have not always done ourselves justice here particularly at exhibitions
however i would like to draw your attention to the fact that in implementing this largescale programmer in regional policy it must cover all of europes regions and i agree with the opinion that this policy should not be nationalized
we have therefore decided to concentrate on a summit statement that will look towards the future and be as concise and substantial as possible and to supplement this with progress reports for political and economic areas
that means nothing more than making strike forces available for intervention
previous speakers have already lamented the fact that we are in this area budgeting for too little overall with the derisory figure of one per cent over the next seven years
our development cooperation is concentrated on sector support for elementary education health and family welfare
in my view this would be a good time to review the dutch system as well
quite the opposite has proven to be the case and we have shown that two plus two do not necessarily make four but can in fact make six
one thing i have not heard mentioned this evening and i want to place this firmly on the agenda is the fact that european producers are dominant in the global heavy commercial vehicle market

i quoted that even the u k where today there is not so much penetration of renewable energy there are calls for this policy meaning this attitude and that we need binding targets because to achieve a longlasting policy goal only binding targets matter
my eighth remark is to point out the importance of using digital means to provide certain medical services diagnosis and monitoring at a distance notably in more remote areas
it is quite clear that the representatives on the standing veterinary committee represent the opinions of the member states and nothing else
but you know we are currently suffering because of the controversy
let us try to look at these matters seriously and find unity among the twenty seven countries each of which has its own history and each of which is experiencing different symptoms from the ongoing financial crisis or different impacts on the real economy
qualitative and quantitative objectives and timetables must be set for the most important environmental problems
l v thank you mr president and commissioners last december in strasbourg mr alumni who was then commissioner for economic and monetary affairs said that barring any significant developments next summer estonia would be invited to join the our area with effect from twenty eleven
we must start with the freedom of people and the fact that we are all in public service voluntarily and the commissioner cannot claim ignorance of this
firstly it should be remembered that this regulation was produced in response to a mandate from the amsterdam european council in july nineteen ninety seven this mandate was restricted to the free movement of goods
i therefore welcome the commissions green paper and the proposal for a review this review will reveal how valid european legislation is evaded in a number of countries and will bring to light flaws that weaken trust in the single market
the fact is that there is a desire to acquire these unused quotas or at least to begin fishing though of an experimental nature on the part of certain member states which are not included as beneficiaries of this agreement or which were excluded – such as the iberian fleets the spanish and the portuguese – at the time of our accession to the european community despite the fact that we have been fishing in those waters for centuries
the practical assistance that the et gives our partner countries in the development and creation of highquality training systems can scarcely be prized highly enough
we consider the ebb to be one of the worlds most transparent central banks our practice of holding a press conference immediately after the governing council meeting on monetary policy each month remains a pioneering initiative that has not yet been replicated by our major sister institutions
the commission first needs to carry out an objective assessment of all available information
the european union has constantly invented itself from the initial vocation of healing a wartorn continent to the building of the internal market and then on to the reunification of europe
an amazing amount has been achieved values and standards have been established the charter has been adopted the pillars have disappeared decisions will be taken by qualified majority more often democratization has moved on by quite a long way parliamentary control has been stepped up transparency enhanced and the institutional structure improved the only discordant note being that we are now after all getting a president something that many did not actually want
mr rübig has come up with a very interesting idea
the promotion of crossborder trade is necessary in any event regardless of the adoption of proposed amendments to the directive on electricity and gas currently in force
it took some time to reach agreement with the commission about where this programmer should be implemented but eventually it was decided to give it to the agency in bilbao that of course is no fault of the agency in bilbao but nevertheless the court of auditors made a very negative comment about this
what i would reproach the commission for is introducing this system at community level and what is more establishing all the necessary conditions for it to be extended
quality early years education can help reduce early school leaving combat educational disadvantages faced by children from disadvantages social and cultural groups and reduce the resulting social inequalities all of which affect society as a whole young people from vulnerable social groups are particularly at risk
the commissioner has mentioned some very specific objectives i hope he will be able to get these adopted in pagoda and i also hope that the community will speak with one voice
various types of special contract such as employment or insurance contracts are therefore dealt with separately
the new framework for commission expert groups provides for clearer and stronger horizontal rules on how to manage conflicts of interest
i would agree that the operation of the commissions services has left much to be desired including under the present commission and i would join with the rapporteur in deploying the absence of specific checks on be between nineteen ninety and nineteen ninety four whatever reasons are given for this
mr woolen raised the question of the new framework for capital requirements they offer a range of approaches
at the european parliament on the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the universal declaration of human rights we are celebrating an occasional conference devoted to human rights
this in the various member states not only raises frequent problems of a comprehensive nature associated with the need to make the role of the state within the economy less cumbersome and to release resources for the market but also causes distortions within the more important sectors of public spending welfare health and publicsector employment which with their automated systems and rules distort spending in such a manner as to make the stability pact either lacking in credibility or a politically intolerable straitjacket for many countries
the committee on agriculture and rural development has considered the document that was submitted and has formulated a number of principles for approval by the house
it has no clear idea of how complex this whole matter is
in this increasingly global world some people want to impose homogeneity on us as if we were all soldiers or units in a production chain
the commissioner said it was one process but the commission still has a start group as part of its strategy from the budget attached to mr color i naval report it appears that there are three times as many errors for the first group
there is also the other side of the coin however which you have not considered here commissioner
that seems to me to be the normal democratic rule
in the first place we need to get the message clearly across that fisheries resources are not limitless just recently the far even pointed out that over sixty of fisheries resources were being over exploited secondly in specific cases as in the case of our amendment and i should like to thank mr adam for having supported it it was possible to place a protected area of juvenile fish under community protection throughout zone diem i x which is important for the preservation of this species
our group also notes the request for the or and the commission to provide information retailing the reasons leading to this confusion of interests
i also note with satisfaction the warm welcome given to the communication entitled and the request that the commission continue its costbenefit analysis of strategies for the reduction of c o two emissions
p l mr president i should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur
so i think you are not comparing like with like there
i would like to ask commissioner bjerregaard if she is able to accept the committees amendments
until now as you know the tradition has been for the general affairs council which is made up of foreign ministers of the various european union countries to be responsible for preparing it
that said i would like to mention the need to strengthen the social dimension of european space policy
i believe that the situation in the new member states where there is a shortage of financial resources for information campaigns on access to electronic services and their quality is also an urgent matter
eighty eight of the eus stocks are overfished against a global average of about twenty seven thirty of our fish species are now officially outside safe biological limits because there are too few adult fish left for normal reproduction
i was very disappointed to see the rejection of mandatory frontofpack labeling with color coding in this report
the kremlin has agreed to initial discussion of the issue in moscow on sixteen november but that is still two months away
i am not talking about workers however
mr president commissioner this is the second time that we have had to increase the guarantee provided by the european union to overcome the difficulties of its members nonmembers of the our zone
on twenty eight march they tried to establish official contacts with the selfstyled leaders of the rebels instead of supporting the lawfully elected town councils and mayors including some of their own political complexion
however i would like to congratulate the rapporteur marisa matias and it is indeed of the utmost importance that the european union should address in a concrete manner the challenge of alzheimers disease as one of its health priorities
however it would be difficult to implement a one size fits all approach i think that we need to focus rather on establishing a common framework with clearly defined objectives and values
the political objective for us at the present time is a twenty five reduction it goes without saying that the widely divergent starting points of the fifteen member states must be taken into account when such targets are set
it is not only this parliament that is starting anew europe is in a period of transition between the treaty of nice and the treaty of lisbon and as we all know it is a time of uncertainty in which we nevertheless need clarity with regard to economic financial labour market and climate policy decisions in the european union and its member states
as far as the member states are concerned we must make it clear that the treaty makes provision during the first two years after accession for access to job markets to be the subject of bilateral agreements or national decisions by the member states
the council s decision shows that there are member states that want to hamper environmental cooperation with russia the way in which some member states are acting in this connection is a display of ignorance of how the system works
question no thirty eight by luis marine h seventy seven thousand, two hundred and ninety seven
there will be no definitive solution without a solution also to this issue of the settlements
i find that extremely disgraceful and it will do more harm than good to europe and the european idea of which i am a great supporter
my british colleagues could then accept the inclusion of cargo handling without any concern
a new minimum import price is the least which can be envisaged but on the basis of past experience we remain sceptical if the circumventing mechanisms which the norwegians have imaginatively put in place are not taken into consideration
allow me in conclusion to explain how the commission of which i have the honour of being president intends to meet these shared challenges and address these shared concerns
there were unfortunately no additional financial resources these had to come out of the european social fund
as you can see italians are operative
however video games are no longer targeted only at children as an everincreasing number of them are designed specially for adults
mr president when the tsars were in power in russia the country had a common legal system
the budgetization of the european development fund which would thus no longer be under the control of our nations diplomatic and political links between supranational bodies such as the european union on the one hand and the african economic community established in nineteen ninety four on the other
i think that it would have been better to concentrate on what mrs van dancer said that we clearly integrate the social dimension a policy for all those who are outside the labour market and have no share in prosperity
it is notably the eurosceptic countries that are pulling their weight the united kingdom denmark and the netherlands to a great extent
a central part of maritime management is the protection of vulnerable ecosystems
this recommendation should be seen in the context of the debate about the green paper on procedural safeguards in particular of a proposal for a framework decision on common minimum standards governing procedural law in which the rapporteur highlights various rights that need to be safeguard and advocates including a nonregression clause for standards already established in each legislation – bringing these into line with the highest levels
we have quite simply acted too late however i am pleased that the austrian presidency seems to represent a turning point in this matter

i therefore believe that my comments relate more to the behaviour of this parliament and fundamentally to the vestiges of an era when its was simply a consultative assembly and did not have the legislative role which it has now
i will expand on these three points today
this special regulation is a sensible measure when it comes to protecting employed workers
that should be our objective
with the right legislative and budgetary procedures for giving the eu the maximum amount of decisionmaking ability and for making its policies as effective as possible the new treaty may help resolve some of the serious problems that europe is facing

i think that the compromise adopted in the days of ioannina was an excellent one and i wonder whether it might not be wise to retain the same ratio in the framework of the new weighting of votes
a study carried out by my party the socialist party in the netherlands has shown that the influx of workers from new member states has resulted in people being pushed aside in the labour market unfair competition for small businesses cheap labour being exploited bad housing and working conditions and wages under our three per hour

el mr president this report seems to have the councils full approval in substance but there is a procedural issue since corner has not yet met i think it is to meet tomorrow or the day after furthermore the slovenian presidency has asked for procedural and official reasons for the meeting to be postponed until the next plenary partsession in belgium

it madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the world population has doubled within a few decades with devastating consequences for the planet and so the fact that the european trend is at least partly different is a positive point
the same reasons which justify why fishermen from each outermost region enjoy an exclusive fishing reserve up to one hundred miles also justify different treatment with regard to aid for renewing and modernizing the fleet

that will be the main objective of the european council meetings of february and march next year

mr president a common point that emerged from the debate we had last month on this resolution was that we need to discuss the issue of freedom of expression everywhere both throughout europe and outside it
this bureaucratic collection of rules solely in the area of some within the dogs is a very costly procedure for providers and organizations applying for these grants this excludes many micro small and mediumsized enterprises as well as smaller associations institutes and nos
president papoulias our parliament welcomes you today as a man of peace and a person committed to european integration

i wish at the same time to express my pleasure and satisfaction at the fact that as rapporteur and the committee as a whole have so kindly dealt with the many amendments i put forward

the european council confirmed at its special summit in tamper that the european union must ensure that thirdcountry nationals are treated fairly
this shows that national currencies would have given the union more stability than the our area has done

how our priorities are distorted

it seems to me that the phenomenon mr turned has referred to which we might describe as the european union entering the second phase of globalisation is leading us to reassess the tools we had at our disposal to deal with the first phase of globalisation that first phase favored price stability or at any rate a reduction in the prices of consumer goods connected in particular with relocation

mr president according to the rules of procedure mr nation is here as the presidentinoffice of the council
this makes a complete nonsense of the effort we have all been making to ensure that our sittings are open and members of the public can participate

this report provides a good opportunity to promote further steps to achieve greater equality of opportunity between men and women and it should not be forgotten also greater equality within the worlds of men and women themselves

i do appreciate the point raised by mr correct on the need for the anomalies in some of the translations to be corrected but i believe that what we can infer from the various speeches that have been made is that although some members have certain reservations about the text or even objections to it most of you ladies and gentlemen agree that this is a balanced text and one that will enable us to regulate a specific situation and which indicates the support that should be given precisely to those political parties that shape and promote the idea of europe in a transparent and responsible way

three the question is of course whether this situation requires a legal ban or selfregulation
our efficiency both in brussels and here in strasbourg depends upon it
the recession in numerous old countries increasing international tension and the resultant general feeling of insecurity are all taking their toll on the lisbon strategy and there has been a delay in achieving our mister objectives
it will have repercussions in the east and there is a lessonlearned process in our joint thinking with our eastern partners
i cite the example of my own country because i know it best
before i conclude madam president i would like to leave two questions on the table for the commission and the council
mr president commissioner i too would like to offer my congratulations to mrs rothbehrendt on her report and to thank her for her openness to discussion on the issues involved

what i expect from you and from the commission because it is apparently commission money we are talking about is not big plans about changing the neighbourhood policy
we also think that we must insist on carrying out a much more depth evaluation on the liberalisation of sectors taking into consideration the interests of consumers and workers and the compatibility of market guidelines with the objectives of sustainable development i am thinking of the water sector for example and not only from a technical point of view but equally through dialogue with all the actors involved
i must now say something about structural policy it is after all the largest chunk accounting for six of these eleven billion namely that account was already taken of the fact that it would probably be difficult to implement all resources in the first year when the interinstitutional agreement was drawn up and signed
according to the human rights organization amnesty international the azerbaijani authorities are trying to stifle critical voices with a view to preventing wider protests the like of which have been seen in the arab world in recent months
deeds not words is exactly what parliament wants when it comes to strengthening economic governance and also when it comes to the legislation on european supervision of the financial institutions
i recall mr mavrommatis and many colleagues who claimed urgent action from the union when i became commissioner in two thousand and four against doing which was the problem of the olympic games
it stipulates in which member state a divorce legal separation or marriage annulment can be applied for and also determines which member state is responsible for making a judgment on parental authority for children of binational marriages when a divorce separation or marriage annulment has been applied for

we have a lot to gain but also some things to lose depending on how we conduct this important relationship
one may be a qualified teacher but what can you do without resources without money especially at european level the council of ministers occasionally shows greater generosity towards european projects but it is difficult for it to do so because as we know with subsidiary education normally remains a national matter

what is the point of it
but let us move on to the bananas

three major questions remain
moreover this concern with the political future of iran should guide any new sanctions that are decided upon within the context of the nuclear question

today we revel in the fact that we have access to all kinds of technology that everything is possible that we have thousands of gadgets at our disposal
let us not forget that sports science is already intensively studying a new form of doing that could prove even more dangerous than previous forms namely genetic doing
let me conclude by sharing with you a personal conviction throughout my political and personal career i have always strongly believed that through engagement and dialogue even the most difficult issues can be addressed and hopefully when the time is right can also be solved
we know that the use of genetic engineering can also help to reduce the amount of pesticides used as well as the use of fertilizers and this in turn would bring environmental advantages in the shape of improved soil and water quality
finally there is a real fear that this will have an immediate and tangible impact on employment in europe in the sectors opened to mexican products especially in already vulnerable sectors such as textiles to name but one
this wave of harassment continued last month when it was directed against dissident writers and defenders of human rights

it continues that the study foreseen in article sixty five a of the ecolabel regulation dealing with additional aspects such as processing prepackaging packaging and transport which will examine the feasibility of the extension of the scope of the ecolabel regulation to food including products of fishing and aquaculture will not influence or prejudge the adoption of this regulation this declaration also clarifies that the ecolabel will be complementary to the specific fishery products regulation
we have recently had a report that some sixty of all transport internal market directives have yet to be transposed by the member states perhaps the commissioner would like to comment on how best we can ensure that this very worthy directive is not only supported here in this house implemented by the council but is actually implemented on the ground by the member states and their enforcement agencies
i would also like to say that in putting forward this view we are not criticizing the jewish people for we hold them dear and condemn all forms of antisemitism

so far as i am aware public opinion in the various member states is not calling for transnational lists
you the council are not even prepared to deny this clique entry visas
the committee is concerned about the risk of fragmentation of the european legal landscape
of course remaining obstacles such as interference on air or on cable t v will have to be solved there is no doubt about that
at the same time however we are preparing for a postlisbon time and this is especially true of foreign policy for example and we need to prepare ourselves for a time when parliament too shows that it has the will to contribute to this new approach to foreign policy
de mr president mrs malmström we definitely do not need walls to resolve the asylum problem

these courses of action require cooperation by turkey and thus i regret that no readmission agreement has yet been reached
for equal opportunity cannot be restricted to the territory of the european union

we now need a sustained campaign to promote greater environmental awareness including a campaign to highlight the importance of keeping groundwave unpolluted and the possible means of achieving this
what we are offering them however is the fundamental right of every european citizen the right to travel freely for the citizens of bona and herzegovina and albania and for the people of the western balkans generally this will be a major and important step on the road to the european union
perhaps i should point out that steering enlargement in the right direction is one of the five priority axes of the belgian presidency
i wish to confirm the great importance the commission attaches and shall attach to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy
i can also say that i am delighted at how lively this debate has been which was in fact just what i had hoped for i am also delighted to have been able to contribute to a debate of such liveliness and intensity particularly given some of the speeches for which i thank you from the bottom of my heart
it is essential that we correct this imbalance by enhancing our powers of jurisdiction
i must remind her that one socialist minister has been found guilty of kidnap and the socialist government of her leader felipe gonzález was found guilty by the court of human rights for the expulsion of one hundred and three immigrants on the border of perilla
above all we must put these actions back into a coherent context and remember that they are entered into on a long term basis
i am sure you know full well that we had numerous episodes against coloured athletes and footballers at numerous events and numerous – mainly football – games in england spain france and so on does the austrian presidency intend to recommend that germany take measures against racism and xenophobia during the world cup next summer and how will you address them given that you will still have the presidency
we have voted against this draft regulation because we do not think that appalling terrorist acts such as those on the world trade center can be opposed by violating fundamental freedoms
after bankrupting the country economically and socially the current romanian government is now implementing ridiculous measures amounting to a serious violation of the fundamental rights recognised in the european union the right to a pension trade union rights the right to a salary and the rights of young mothers
furthermore the commission welcomes the common position agreed by old members in paris to launch fresh discussions on a new agreement on shipbuilding involving major nonoecd shipbuilding nations
there are too many responsibilities too may targets
transparency of european decisions must be at the heart of our work
universities have been cooperating on scientific matters for a long time past
although yet more detailed rules may be laid down in future the text that has been adopted represents a positive compromise in the harmonization of existing regulations guaranteeing secure purchases and putting a definitive end to typical sharp practices that hide behind electronic purchasing

we must try nonviolent methods we must stop the war and we must not allow it to result in the militarisation of the eu
it is sad and devastating to learn that these diseases are still killing even though treatments exist
this in my view is a very constructive way of giving this issue the attention it deserves
this is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in el ejido
the next item is the council and commission statements on the worrying situation in the retention centres for immigrants especially in the islands of layette and lampedusa
however we are not happy with the compromise which has emerged and therefore voted against paragraph two in amendment seventy seven which concerns consumer contracts
the debate at porto alert on what there were described as principles values human rights diversity and equality is not entirely unrelated to what at days was called a debate on trust and values
the question arises for me as an elected representative from a mediumsized state how the convention will ensure that the big states will not dominate in the future
it launches the idea of transnational collective bargaining
in this case moreover i believe that my group and the majority of this house are calling for a resolution welcoming pinochets arrest and also urging the governments to do their duty
young people are the first victims of unemployment and are very prone to dropping out of school
for now the commission can only maintain its initial proposal
finally it is unacceptable that the banks should not yet have developed a cheap and efficient system for crossborder consumer payments
i would therefore like to put the following question to commissioner onion would it not be a good idea if the commission concentrated more on minimum standards which raised levels everywhere but which did not prevent some countries from going further would that not be better than total harmonization which is fundamentally a commercial rule aimed at promoting commercial interests not food quality
this can be achieved only if the vital interests of certain member states are not put at stake we must make no compromises on the basic principles of independence and effectiveness that should govern the activity of energy transmission system operators and energy regulators

i should like of course to clarify something that to me seems obvious but which bears repeating and that is that these council reforms only refer to internal reforms to internal organization and that in no case does the council intend to address issues that require a reform of primary law because this of course is a matter for the intergovernmental conference and for the european convention preparing the intergovernmental conference
in those areas however parliament must obtain the right to participate in decision making and in addition the right to full decisionmaking powers where the agricultural budget is concerned
that is not in my opinion the right way forward for then we would retain the unanimity rule which in turn means vetoes and perhaps paralysis
we thus support the rapporteurs amendments which want member states to be able to retain these higher safety standards
last year the european union sent the region a clear sign of its wish to make a greater contribution to conflict prevention to conflict resolution and to rehabilitation following conflicts

according to article seventy one parliament possesses the power of initiative and both paragraphs accord it the right of approval
those who like the group of the european party christian democrats and european democrats are trying today in this parliament to contain immigration are in reality creating more problems than they solve we should not have accepted the schengen agreement with the abolition of permanent controls at internal borders and we should not have accepted the treaty of amsterdam or rather the communitisation of the bulk of the policies on asylum visas and immigration including the fight against illegal immigration
in helsinki we agreed to open accession talks with lava lithuania bulgaria romantic slovakia and malta as the extraordinary european council meeting in tamper had been unanimous on the matter hardly any further debate was needed
in the services sector any activity beyond the national market is still classed as the provision of services abroad and not within a single entity namely the european union

i would also like to ask him this does he not find that there is unemployment in the united kingdom
they do not necessarily have the negotiating power of larger companies and therefore provision is made for them
however parliament can now point the way
moreover the union is firmly resolved to give its support to the actual setting up of the court
if we want this principle to be used with respect to persons accused of terrorism we cannot give a negative example ourselves
on this point i would say that even cooperatives working in traditional sectors such as social welfare have been innovative in that they have been firmly rooted in the local community and have responded to local needs
the year two thousand and nine saw sixty five of petitions submitted line and i am proud to say that ireland has the highest per capita submission of petitions in the eu

in all member states and in all areas there is still plenty of room for improvement and a need for it

but it does seem somewhat ironic to me that we have been voting in this place all week to save the planet but we still ride around strasbourg in our chauffeurdriven mercedes
but there is no lack of concern or consideration in the current commission despite the fact that it is coming to the end of its life in these issues
visa policy is mentioned in the report too i consider this to be a crucial matter and we should pay great attention to monitoring the issue of visas and the operation of border crossings on the territory of the new schengen countries
in my view the opportunity to request an internal review for which provision is made in the common position should not be confused with access to justice
in fact quite contrary to the statements made in the resolution and during the debate there is still a serious risk that the charter if incorporated into the treaties and given legal value will be immediately appropriated in the most imprudent way by a militant and fired minority next it will be thrown off course so as to effectively limit the competences of the member states to a very considerable degree precisely where the central core of the sovereignty and selfdetermination of their peoples are concerned tending to superimpose itself on the systems of fundamental rights of the member states and to subordinate them entirely
i understand the commissioners difficulty in explaining why this has happened

as the rapporteur said it is true that not all of the aspirations of the european parliament contained in its previous report drawn up by our friend and former colleague mr georgios anastasopoulos have been taken into account
whatever some members may claim it is certainly not the intention to go beyond what is needed to enable the community to be a party to the århus convention
nothing else
europes linguistic diversity therefore represents a vital cultural asset and it would be a mistake for the european union to limit itself to just one main language
this is why this report is so important
the reports we are presenting to you also look at the implications of enlargement for the candidate countries neighbours that is other european countries and for the mediterranean
we need firm action on this we need it soon
polands foreign minister geremek stated last week in the committee for foreign affairs that its policy will be directed towards developing good neighbours relationships with germany with the russian federation with the baltic states and with the urine

in conclusion it must be obvious that given the complex problems in albania the european union is faced with a major challenge
the report opens the debate on the future of the common european asylum policy which was launched in june two thousand and seven with the publication of a green paper
we need doctors architects and people to relieve the pain of the tragedy
finally nothing has been said of the elephant in the room namely the absolute unsustainability of the greek debt and the irish debt
however the major problem remains that the report merely describes the actions of the eu
another example does he know what the world cereal prices are going to be next year
i like many european citizens also wish to have a constitution that is more federal more socially minded and which encompasses a genuine common foreign and defence policy
i am thus pleased with mr stevensons resolution
five hundred administrators attended from all the management authorities from the whole of europe
this does not seem realistic to us at least for the moment all further liberalization should be rejected given that there has been no evaluation of the results of directive ninety one thousand, four hundred and forty on an objective basis
it is important to highlight the role of the pa as it has succeeded in establishing itself as a key player in northsouth cooperation contributing to strengthening open and democratic dialogue between the eu and the act group of states
that is the key difference compared with the current states in europe the latter are generally united with one people one common history one language and more or less one culture
we all make mistakes
wellinformed eurosceptic though i am i do believe there cannot in that area at least be enough cooperation
d g v has asked the legal service for advice on this matter and the issue appears to be quite complicated
the commission will therefore from now on provide a report on the followed of each serious payment error
all it lacks is clearly calling the holodomor a crime of genocide
it follows that we must clarify matters completely as soon as possible because i am afraid that it will have as its consequence very low turnout at the next elections
as well as making their intellectual ability available to their host countries these young researchers often return to their countries of origin where they become part of the management class formers of opinion and culture and they bring with them the baggage of personal relationships developed in the countries that posted them
we should therefore welcome any step in the direction of cooperation between the eu and russia at various levels and in various forms
in particular the following are worthy of note
we will definitely deliver this report will not stay on the shelf but we will use it as working document
the programmer will undoubtedly improve external border protection and make it possible to modernism the armed forces of the eu member states
as far as the commission is concerned it will ladies and gentlemen be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate
after this vote the media called and asked me a number of times whether i had voted for or against
i agree with this report and voted for it
the report by mr line works towards this and has some positive aspects that deserve recognition particularly all those that refer to conditions of employment resolving disputes and tax liability but in other respects it may be that the situation we have now is fairer than that envisaged in the regulation
a compromise amendment was reached which brought together the differing viewpoints held by the members of our committee
do something about this problem commissioner
therefore when we talk about many of the issues around retraining and developing skills et we should also be looking at the called just transition programmer worked out with the ill the it and the un because the skills we are looking for at the moment are beginning to change
this is not really the same as competition dare i extend mr hökmarks remarks and suggest that if the commission is truly interested in promoting competition it should include regulatory competition
i waited as long as i was supposed to and stopped waiting when i came into this sitting
we want to continue supporting turkey that is the opinion of my group
i understand the german taxpayers they know that they will have to pay but german taxpayers cannot always pay
bearing this in mind this house should in any event demand that before the community support frameworks for the period in question are approved they be studied and submitted for debate in this parliament specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today this is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and leastdeveloped regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in european society and to the move towards a fairer europe
thirdly the effectiveness of the system must be guaranteed by ensuring that it is applied intelligently with the participation of the european parliament
an additional sum of our one million should be added to line in addition to the result of the separate vote on this line
i would like to point to the example of the current presidency on family policy
let me start by making a number of observations
thus russia has recently concluded an agreement with urine bears and kazakhstan on the formation of a common economic area the eu has its own separately agreed arrangements with these countries
mr maskadovs foreign minister has proposed provisional administration of chechnya by the united nations precisely to reassure the russian authorities and to establish within five or ten years a chechnyan administration that would provide a guarantee against the threats to russian security
this means that the lack of reliable and stable structures and mechanisms is hindering successful work in this area
these are also as a rule made available to the public via the ebbs website
it is a principle of good sense which should help us in the negotiations with third countries
in the vote a very large majority of the piece group will be expressing its confidence in the commission
thousands have sustained injuries as a result of physical violence used in the process of patriotic education
the commission has the greatest sympathy for the many thousands of policyholders and pensioners who have suffered severe financial loss as a result of the serious problems encountered by the equitable life insurance company

the world bank classified those living on an income of less than one dollar a day as the absolutely poor
the european union is of course part of the solution

the commission is right to state that eu regulations on emissions standards are the best way to reduce emissions from ships in eu ports territorial waters and exclusive economic zones
governments have a huge responsibility for the transition that has to be made
we have become used to it
the lack of identity of the area itself and the traditional sensitivities of certain eu countries towards russia both political for example urine moldova the southern caucasus and the frozen conflicts and economic the increased european dependence on russian gas and the delicate status of the turkey negotiations are probably among the reasons why the eu has limited itself to synergy instead of strategy
even now however we can state that there is an absolute need to identify rules for surveillance of economic policies rules that are not mechanistic but realistic and sustainable able to strengthen fiscal policy and improve european governance as a whole
it is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it it is to that end that our efforts are now engaged
but as regards what mr month said in his speech i should like to mention two matters
the resolution on which we voted in the committee on the environment public health and food safety is largely in keeping with the analysis and with the policy and the willingness of commissioner oettinger
i hope that we can in this way too leave a permanent imprint of our presidency on the work of the union
in this way brussels is becoming increasingly remote from those it claims to represent and that is bad for democracy

only in this way can europe provide itself with effective and transparent and therefore credible policies which are in our citizens interest
opposition to the implementation of the directive is now required
mr de too is right also at second reading to adhere to previous choices made by parliament with regard to the restriction of nighttime pollution short terms clear definitions of noise pollution and daughter directives on noise emissions of lorries buses motorcycles trains and aircraft
i want to ask you however one more thing namely that when structuring the commission s work and policy in the balkans you will really use to the full the imagination that i am sure you commissioner and many of your colleagues possess
in fact a whole series of worthwhile practical initiatives were decided on in luxembourg and that is why we do not thankfully need to start from scratch

when the coin council adopted the common position last month it took up the five amendments the commission had accepted in its modified proposal these relate i would remind you to the need for a reliable system an effective system and a system acceptable to all the citizens of the european union

this report will also contain our evaluation of the developments in the field of democracy and the protection of human rights

the murder of an intellectual like lulu adult a writer who was known for his tolerance and seems to have had the confidence of the people on that island and ended up being punished with his death while the turkish authorities in chorus stood aside is a form of violence which we witness every day whether it is in chorus bona or anywhere else it all results from the fall of that other empire the soviet empire
this created huge structures of low productivity squandered resources probably destroyed the traditional sources of wealth to a large extent bred corruption and finally deprived the algerians of hope especially the young this in turn led many of them to turn to solutions which are supposedly based on religion but which are far removed from the true islamic faith solutions which border on magic and even false miracles
i want to make a point of stating this here emphatically
like the european union schengen has grown
we have a common agricultural policy
as regards turkey we in the presidency welcomed the closure of the organ park case and made it clear at the recent meeting of the troika in vienna that we expect the trials still pending under article three hundred and one of the turkish penal code to be dealt with similarly or indeed the law to be changed
i strongly believe that this relationship is vital if we are to ensure that the eu is built on democratic foundations
to find a way out of this situation which kills industrial employment and plunges employees and their families into destitution there must be strict control of capital movements by member states tax havens must be destroyed the sectors essential to life energy water medicines agriculture and training must be removed from the field of commerce and above all environmental and social criteria guaranteeing equality in commercial activity and the rights of employees must be defined and enforced
it must not be used as a pretext for intensifying and strengthening the electronic filing systems created under europol and schengen which target not only refugees but also the fundamental individual freedoms of the citizens of the eu themselves
i should like to underline that these efforts to moderate are spread across the compulsory and noncompulsory expenses
however it would be in everybody interest if we could in some way clarify the definition of developing countries
i would like to call on governments to promote insulation in housing and the other measures that i have mentioned
that is why it is so important that this report should ask the member states just where they are how far they have come and just what they have done about achieving the great targets that we set ourselves at lisbon
on behalf of my group i most emphatically reiterate this request
we cannot simply flout to rules on the goods trade section of peas
but without increasing awareness without training of workers and the people responsible for health without horizontal prevention policies without a culture of prevention as the commissioner said and without sufficient information decisions on the content of regulations will be of little use

there can though be no doubt that responsibility for adherence to the climate change objectives rests primarily with the states that signed the kyoto protocol that is with the member states of the european union that burden sharing is a voluntary agreement within the european union and that the measures proposed by the commission and supported by parliament must not be allowed to frustrate these objectives
we ought to bear that in mind
i have one comment about fronted as well what some member states are doing here is scandalous

in terms of visual images as the rapporteur remarked the sight of a lorry held up on a highway is unfortunately all too common so far as i am aware however the problem for workers has never been that they have been physically prevented from crossing a border or reaching their place of work which would have been the equivalent situation

organization and management of the internet policy issues nineteen ninety eight two thousand
and lastly i would advocate a further extension of the role of independent ombudsmen for the banking and insurance sector

in this connection i should immediately add another comment about the commission because in the letter of amendment for next agricultural budget two initiatives have been included with regard to the quality of agricultural products and the future funding of infectious animal diseases

directives need to be changed but so do attitudes what can you say about the statement by the council that outsiders should not be given documents relating to legal advice in connection with legislative procedure

as chair of the delegation for relations with switzerland iceland and norway and to the european economic area sea joint parliamentary committee i fully understand that of course every application has to be dealt with on its own merits and progress is being made
this is a big step forward and augurs well for the coming discussions with the council
the text that parliament received two years ago however can be said to sneak this possibility in through the back door
mr salvador garriga polled mr färm and others stressed the very limited room for maneuver but the conclusion could be more flexibility in the shaping and implementation of the budget
we expressed the opinion that the violations of resolution one thousand, four hundred and forty one thus far identified by the inspectors did not justify military action

the eu s great challenge is to now convince the less developed countries and civil society of the benefits of a broadbased round finland as the country holding the presidency will endeavour to ensure that the final decision on the commencement of the forthcoming round the form it will take and its agenda will be taken at the meeting of to ministers to be held in seattle in november to december

i welcome the conclusions reached by the committee on transport and tourism and the report presented and can assure you that many of the issues are already being addressed by the commission in various activities to implement the strategy such as the proposal on reporting formalities for ships an important element of the common maritime transport space without barriers
i also welcome the fact that the directive will actually become a regulation and will have greater legal emphasis i therefore welcome this piece of work and i congratulate all of the rapporteurs for managing to reach a consensus over an issue as sensitive as the introduction of cosmetic products onto the european market based on scientific developments

imagine for a moment that we were in nineteen seventy before the oil crisis before the fall of the wall and with only a few member states and we had to use the expertise that we had in nineteen seventy to shed light on twenty ten and the current energy situation
i believe that the digital age will see the acceleration of current developments in the services offered by the media which are far from being limited to traditional television or even to the internet but include many other services and so it is right and necessary that we give thought to the legal form that control and the protection of young people might take and also set up the means for dealing with them
mr president what i have noted today in this house in particular is the absence of the commissioner responsible for the two sectors – agriculture and fisheries – who should be taking the initiative to propose measures to alleviate the negative impact of the rise in oil prices on two sectors which are unquestionably his responsibility
two only at member state level and only after eu law on aid has been adapted is it to be decided on a casebycase basis whether and by how much an installation can be compensated for energy cost rises

the provisional figures published by the commission follow the same path
we call on keys political leaders to do everything in their power to prevent further violence in the country and to ensure respect for human rights

multinationals cannot get off scotfree they should be called to account
i say to the commissioners that we look forward to what they are going to be doing in the coming year although perhaps i could start with what they are not going to be doing because it would be helpful to hear from them again a new list of steps that they are not going to take

as to my third point i stand by my opinion i believe that from a political and indeed a democratic perspective it is not sensible to hold called debates at such a late hour and i look forward to seeing the commissioner again with our mutual friend mr staffed in the hotel laurin in volcano and conducting a dialogue there
i believe that the difficulty we have and that you in the commission have in particular is in essence the fact that you have to reconcile two different strategies

two instruments with limited legal effect have hitherto been used to regulate the transport of dangerous goods by inland waterway

very briefly how can we implement that coordination of economic policies without the instruments to do so
the same applies to the forwarding of data to third countries

we need binding targets and strict regulations
the result is sensible modernization which we can fully support
europe can no longer tolerate this situation and not only because of its christian roots innocent people are dying merely because they are followers of one religion and not another

one of the most obvious reasons why certain countries have broken the three of deficit rule is that when they were at positive points in their economic cycle they did not apply procyclic policies they did not sufficiently consolidate their public finances and there are instruments in the treaty such as early warnings which furthermore are strengthened in the constitution and directly attributed to the commission which must be used more effectively

the commission has comprehensively described the community law framework
particular account should be taken of the human rights situation and the situation of the greek ethnic group in the talk area of georgia where there are serious problems with both the human rights and property rights of the greek community
i should like to conclude by saying that my personal experience has taught me that openness and transparency are of great value in preempting fraud and corruption in an organization
that is an urgent political request which is not legally binding but it is a further sign that the council takes seriously the issue of principle highlights by the honorable member

but it should also be understood that conditions now definitely demand that the legislation in place should guarantee transparency and predictability because it is a very longer investment
on behalf of the piece group hu technological innovation opens up tangible new opportunities for europe
as things stand nice is the
they are very successful in doing this as the statistics show such virtual loss offsetting has in fact meant that over the last twenty years the amount of tax paid on the profits made by the multinationals has fallen continuously

mr presidentinoffice of the council firstly i would like to thank the presidencyinoffice of the council for their high level presence in this house and for their positive attitude
unfortunately the original project became distorted in committee and an attitude prevailed that was inspired by fear rather than hope
conversely i think that air traffic control personnel have gained a european dimension that will make them think differently in future and probably play a more active part in the next stages of the single european sky

the russians often appear to be the most avid readers of those geopolitical experts who predict conflict between the islamic and christian civilizations some ideological gymnastics being necessary here in respect of the positions they held not so long ago
burma must entirely stop persecuting and imprisoning prodemocracy activists and must release those who are already in prison

the question is and i am in fact concurring with the comments made by mr wiersma just now whether it is really all that advisable to start a broad discussion with each other on a common defence policy when we have not been able to make any progress on common foreign policy and most definitely not on common security policy
the commission notes parliaments wish to be briefed on the committees work but as far as following up on this amendment is concerned we would refer to the institutional practice adopted in other cases that consists of oral briefings to parliament since the commission is cautious about making that committees discussions public because this would jeopardize the confidentiality of project selection
citizens must also be protected however from unnecessary and unwanted state interference in the private sphere
alzheimers disease is the main cause of dementia and accounts for over forty four zero sufferers in ireland and about ten million across europe
therefore on two september two thousand and eight the commission adopted a communication to the council on the opening of consultations with mauritania under article ninety six of the cotonou agreement

the commission proposal states in particular that agency shall facilitate the application of community measures relating to network and information security
we voted against the joint resolution noting that everyone who signed it has huge political responsibility in misleading the people as to the future of the un and at the same time accepting the imperialist barbarism which needs to be overturned

because the save i i programmer for which appropriations of cu one hundred and fifty metres were proposed was cut to cu forty five metres by the council just imagine germany is referring to its subsidiary austria was actually in favour of it being cut to cu thirty five metres
the report is otherwise excellent
is there not some contradiction here
the recent plans of the european union to bring in a limit at a lower ceiling than previously planned namely at a level of six hundred and eighty eight tones of c o two per tone of manufactured product may lead to a disastrous situation for cement producers in many european countries including poland
de madam president commissioner i would like to congratulate you on this package in particular it represents a major step forward for our citizens in europe
how can we reproach producers for utilizing the resources of a system however worthy of criticism it may be
i am thinking of corporations and concerns but also of small enterprises and not only those operating in the field of transport and logistics
it puts the use of resources and environmental protection under the heading of solidarity it should put them under the heading of prosperity because until we learn that the environment and green growth is part of prosperity rather than solidarity we will not have the correct perspective on such matters
currently the main responsibility of care tends to lie with the spouse or child of the dementia patient which can be extremely hard work and emotionally grumbling
this talks of the european union as living proof that peace stability freedom and prosperity can be brought to a continent and as a model showing the world the way forward it concludes that our neighbours have the chance to join this prosperity and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so
on foreign policy i would like to stress the role of the european parliament and my political group in insisting on having more details about the rumors of fraud and misuse of funds in the echo programmer
i believe this figure should be retained for plaice and sole as for the other longer plans

this approach is the basis on which my counterparts in the other fourteen member states and i have been working in close collaboration with commissioner divine reading
rapporteur mr president i do not think this can be added as an addition it should be taken separately
my group is tabling several amendments but following on from mr area speech i would like to say that while we think that amendment no two from the piece group is entirely superfluous and we are neither in favour or against it we and myself in particular as a galician and vicechair of the committee on fisheries think that amendment no one is irrelevant and what is more dangerous because no one has questioned the vigor of the scientific testing or the healthiness of the food chain
the second report was published recently and goes into more depth as regards the lack of education and training the severe limits in terms of cultural production technology and research
when we went on our mission to tunisia a few days ago the only islamist party alnahda told us quite sincerely that it found inspiration in keep tayyip erdoğans amp and so in some way people look to turkey to be able to have a frontage towards europe but they do not know whether the opposite frontage europe is willing to take it into consideration
it is quite remarkable that none of the proposals discussed in the intergovernmental conference mark any step forward but are all retrograde when compared with the draft the intergovernmental conference is in reverse gear

to date the cost of pollution has not been included in chemical control
there is only one way to regain the consumers trust and that is by guaranteeing the quality of the products
entrusting them to the member states therefore means running the risk of failure
but it seems that a worthy agenda of human rights has now been hijacked by greedy lawyers and political opportunists
we are perhaps at the end of the beginning but now the real normal legislative process is just starting and the european parliament as the colegislator has indeed the crucial and decisive role
ro mr president the kidnapping and subsequent murder of antoine de lecture and vincent memory in niger give us a painful reminder of the need to implement a strategy for promoting security stability and good governance in the she region
the energy twenty twenty strategy published by the european commission in november also ranks energy efficiency as the highest priority
proper agreements on readmission at european level and the common european protection of immigrants fundamental rights are needed
this operation would be extremely costly for citizens in psychological terms and would serve only to provide ideological satisfaction for those who wish to see nations disappear
i probably cannot emphasis sufficiently the need to speed up the pace of structural reforms in the labour and product markets given their positive impact on the our areas ability to better withstand external shocks as well as to increase its growth potential
that is what it is about
money is not enough however instead we must ensure that the commission obtain a sufficient number of qualified staff so that it is not isolated employees who are trying to push ahead with these issues
mr presidentinoffice of the council the military action has clear humanitarian objectives and we very strongly urge you to adhere to those objectives
we have defined more broadly than the commission the legal constructions that these jurisdictions will have to show either do not exist on their territory or are fiscally transparent and i believe that this reversal of the burden of proof is a more effective way of fighting tax evasion
our industry will be more competitive at international level this applies particularly to small and mediumsized enterprises which will find it easier to access this market thanks to the clearer more predictable rules
i feed elements of this kind into every summit that we have with russia
we will not be giving anything to chechnya suffering from genocide or to alleviate the situation in iraq apart from that shameful little bribe worthy of the dealers of southern italy apart from two hundred million out of thirty five billion

your vote has obviously not been counted if you did not have a card
it is regrettable that certain countries such as the united states are set on spoiling the results of the diplomatic conference which is taking place in rome
this is why i think it is very important that the peas should be set up in a way which allows it to work very closely with the commission and the council and to respect the need to be fully accountable to the european parliament

i do think though that it is disappointing that the rapporteur should take so narrow a view of the future of the european textile sector as lying in a euromediterranean zone
i am writing to you on the subject today
it is a scandal that no mention whatever is made of the human rights situation in turkey and the assertion that it will be considered in a separate report does nothing to remedy that omission

this would enable the repayment of debts in all our member states
in this area i appeal for the members understanding and support thank you
one is the birds directive and another one is the habitats directive under which it is clearly specified what is protected how on which level and so on so basically it is pretty broad legislation and is not only covering some specific endangered and disappearing species or other

we also agree with its confirmation of multilateralism and the ranking of priorities in foreign policy and even with the positions it adopts on the middle east
our negotiations with the candidate countries will be gradual steady careful and thorough
in accordance with the principle of subsidiary member states will decide whether to use private or public companies for the implementation of public services

mr president before the vote on the legislative resolution i should just like to confirm again that the changes which the commission has made to amendments nos two and three are of an editorial nature rather than a substantive one insofar as an amendment represents a supplement to the existing legal text in other words that these changes are in accordance with what we are voting on here so that we shall then have a common position from parliament and the commission
of course we cannot accept that
the disclosure documents which were published on twenty december two thousand and two with a deadline of eight january two thousand and three initially made it impossible for the european salmon producers group to comment due to christmas and the new year

speculation has been responsible for almost fifty of the recent price rises so a concerted strategy within the g twenty should be used to encourage the creation of price stabilization instruments within international forums

informing and stimulating the discussion of ideas consolidating the sentiment of citizenship contributing to the strengthening of the european spirit distributing products of various origins and fostering exchanges and productions between the member states
this was the precise tenor of what i said and nothing more
i was astonished to hear the speech just given by my colleague from the greens
asylum and immigration and policies on tackling crime and terrorism are of crucial concern to cities
as commissioner responsible for development i can already foresee thanks to the main amendment which will no doubt be adopted the prospects of effectiveness the positive prospects that will be offered especially as some speakers suggested in countries within my remit where vocational training is a crucial factor
however such a perspective is entirely missing from mr titles report
yes europe is responsible when along with the commission certain parties urge rapid inhumane and brutal liberalisation and yes europe now appears to everyone to be the real driving force behind this process
it does not help to blame others in this difficult situation instead we should look ahead

for the central areas and for the alpine regions in particular it is clear that they will choose to do so
that convention will be holding its first session on twenty eight february in the european parliament in brussels what place could better reflect both the importance of the new phase the european union is going through and the recognition the presidency wishes to give to the european parliament s work on the future of europe

i also want to draw attention to one weaker moment in the report although the rapporteur has drawn attention to it namely to the fact that modern untried technologies need to be assessed and it is good that in three years time we will be able to do this i also call for the role of the european data protection supervisor to nevertheless be taken into account
i voted in favour of the resolution on the current twenty eleven budget negotiations because it is essential that parliament takes up its new and legitimate role in defining the european unions budget now that the treaty of lisbon has entered into force as the conciliation committee has failed to reach agreement despite all parliaments efforts we have restates a number of points on which the council needs to be flexible

when we established the european food authority we emphasized how important it was that communication should be commensurate with the level of risk
that said i endorse what has been said by other members who believe that we need to vote in favour of this as otherwise everything will go down the drain
constructive criticism of the commission must not go unheard due to parliament s internal bickering
for leonardo we accept amendments nos one to five seven and eight eleven to nineteen twenty two to twenty four twenty seven twenty nine to thirty five thirty seven and thirty eight forty one and forty two forty six and forty seven forty nine to fifty five fifty seven and fifty eight for the youth programmer we accept amendments nos one to fifteen seventeen to nineteen twenty one twenty two twenty four twenty six twenty eight to thirty one thirty four thirty six thirty nine to forty two forty six forty nine fifty two fifty seven and fifty nine
there are many other initiatives being worked out that are directly aimed at combating fraud for example the green paper on the transparency initiative and the question of whether to publish the names of the recipients of subsidies or at least to make them public to bring them to the attention of the commission
you can read these conclusions which are attached to my report and as rapporteur i am quite prepared to accept the conclusions numbered one d two a two b and six b
however we cannot do this alone
this does not after all happen with other industries such as manufacturing and services
nonetheless we support the aims of this directive and the work the commissioner has done on it
i would like to mention an amendment which i tabled in the committee on the internal market and consumer protection regarding the need to facilitate access to and support the development of the internet in new member states particularly in rural areas european villages especially those in the eastern part of the eu must not be excluded from the discussions on the next steps in internet governance
i was then appointed rapporteur on two july nineteen ninety six i considered that this proposal which was admittedly wellintentioned still jeopardize the positive action which we at least in the committee on womens rights still consider to be necessary in order to achieve equal treatment and opportunities for women and men should we want to see this equality before the year three thousand
considering the significant economic returns from such programmes i voted in favour of the reek report which calls on the commission and the member states to ensure sufficient funding in order to make sure these projects are completed by twenty eighteen thus asserting themselves as credible challengers to the american system
i do not agree with mr tannock that it should be included in the end but we ought to look at ways of improving our relationship with kazakhstan
even more businesses will join and it is then even more important that we know where the money ends up
following the vote in the committee on civil liberties justice and home affairs the scheme has been watered down significantly
it is now the turn of the other speakers on the list twenty speakers are listed to speak and as per the apportionment of time decided by the groups the majority of these speeches will last for one or two minutes
thus despite the useful ideas in the motion on issues such as the role of the european parliament and the national parliaments the development of social policy or referenda i obtained from the final vote
they have to know how to protect themselves
do we need to strengthen the european instruments
parliament has given this an exceptional amount of time and an exceptional degree of effort and many of the assistants and people in my own d g worked exceptionally hard on this to try and reach what we thought would be an acceptable compromise
we also know that we need animal experimentation and that this animal experimentation has fortunately reduced in recent years because we have set ourselves the goal of finding alternative solutions
i am opposed to wordings of this type and have voted against the report as a whole
a greater number of small and mediumsized enterprises can have more ready access to eu funds for economic stimulus while the administration is able more quickly and simply to determine whether these funds are being used properly
in general terms vast amounts of energy are being wasted in the eu as a whole
for a country with a lot of water like the netherlands that ten metres is a problem
it is only by adopting the right position and having a clearlystated standpoint that we will be able genuinely to provide humanitarian aid and most importantly to support the emergence of a viable democratic palestinian state
paper is patient but we are not a lack of ambition is not something that bulgaria can afford at this decisive point in its history
nevertheless the intention is good and should be applauded
that is the political will of the draftsmen
the best way for the european union to force the turkish government to meet its commitments a method which is lacking in hypocrisy and which does not allow a pretext for further liberal pressure which only in any case serve the interests of free trade in europe would be to support the democratic opposition
overall we are therefore pleased with the compromise the industry committee is prepared to support the entire package
all of that is necessary but insufficient because we are also in a climate of localization which has to be seen as an opportunity but which requires european industry to be competitive and to adapt more quickly
i am thinking especially of the defence of our dutch language of our culture and identity in our capital city of brussels and in the area of flanders around brussels the vlaamse rand
therefore i hope that the governing council will also note its treaty obligations in the manner of its decisiontaking by majority
but this potential has not been exhausted by any means
let me put that question in very graphic terms the reason why the convention was so very successful was that this issue was the cement holding the whole thing together
we need to definitely intensify cooperation in the field of security and defence policy
there is an obvious misunderstanding of the meaning and serious importance of the principle of a common but differentiated responsibility when placing the worlds major historical polluters such as the us the biggest global emitter per capita which is resisting making serious commitments to reduce its emissions on an equal footing with emerging economies such as china or india with per capita emissions that are ten and four times lower respectively than those of the us
it is at war and a bloody war at that which is dragging on and on
question no four by h twenty nine thousand, four hundred
above all i do not believe that we have made it sufficiently clear that we do not simply want to restrict software patents we actually do not want to grant any more of them in future at all
mr president ladies and gentlemen human rights are indivisible
he knows that we wanted to be more ambitious on some points and that we wanted to sum up what the contribution of the european union should be in more concrete terms
i welcome the amendment that supports a change in one rules so that there is no longer an automatic incentive to slaughter rather than to vaccinate
yet mr correct is a bit daring for he knows the rules of procedure inside out or rather he is allowed to take the risk
this can only be achieved by recognizing and correcting the mistakes in copenhagen which the european parliament resolution fails to do
to conclude i welcome the fact that this interinstitutional spirit is emerging we would like to promote that respecting the fact that each institution has the right to take its own decisions
since then we have seen a hopeful process with legislation and programmes that make our environmental priorities a reality
this raises the question of how much the population benefits from the countrys wealth or is it only the few who do so
firstly the plan is dump the common agricultural policy
we need to continue the erasmus programmer
europe must not fall in line with the us model which gives priority to research and development in the military sphere above any potential civilian applications
results are fine for showing the areas in which we are in fact visibly active
again as i have said the question of comitology was raised as it was in the previous debate and i repeat that the proposal to suspend it after two years except for article twenty six is acceptable to the commission in this particular directive
the is should not prescribe a particular market structure
the real difference lies between those who look to the future to new ways of peace and cooperation and those who cling to the past to the old ways of violence and division that is the divide we wish to break down
waste is also an extremely profitable business and on that business the commission has its beady eye in this proposal on waste shipments
if food production cannot be increased we must change the basis for its distribution as well as our trading relations
i do not know what the answer would be but what i do know is that there is absolutely no basis for suggesting that the commission would reach an agreement when we have expressly said that we would not do so without meeting the legitimate and reasonable concerns that have been expressed
one fundamental issue relates to the selective imposition of punitive us duties on imports from thirteen member states
this means that there is no doubt in relation to the position of the member states on social policy
we have no choice but to vote against this draft resolution as we did in july
it needs to be stressed that these voluntary agreements on trade in timber cannot undermine the eus overall objective of combating climate change and must guarantee sustainable use of forests
i wish him a speedy recovery
however i would like us to be somewhat more circumspect in our relations with russia
why should we predefine the issues on which citizens can raise an initiative
the crucial thing is that this minimum income is regulated in such a way that it acts as a lever to elevate people in poverty to an acceptable standard of living and that it can never be an incentive for people to act passively in a difficult situation namely by potentially lacking commitment in looking for a job
we comment on it because it is growing and developing as confidence increases in the past it was the european parliamentarians who dominated every debate and that i am glad to say is no longer the case
the most recent of those was last august for less than a month
in addition the commission has also undertaken to carry out the study requested by the european parliament
as a fuel hydrogen will provide us with an environmentally safe renewable energy source
article eight of the directive provides that from nineteen ninety eight in other words from this year onwards member states must publish the results of their investigations of residues in the coming year the commission will present a report to parliament and the council on the basis of the results submitted by the member states
current trends and the now open structure of the single european state are unacceptable
lastly we must insist again on the doubling of the budget
the specific nature of the agricultural sector should be taken into account its dependence on climatic conditions questions of quality related to food security conditions of production and the problem of safeguarding the worlds food supply
in declaring our groups vote in favour of the resolution presented by mr barzanti on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and citizens rights we wished to mention the possible contradiction that might arise between the future community directive and the commitment made by the union in the mia so that the commission clarifies accurately as soon as possible that it will undertake to allow the inspiration reaffirmed here in parliament to prevail
a programmer being broadcast several times a day on two state television channels uses slander and lies to imply that poland wishes to bring about the collapse of bears and to interfere in its domestic affairs
reference is made to the french example when france given the very strong reserves of the people has just abandoned the project of regionalisation of its electoral system
in writing p t the recent rise in food prices is due largely to successive reforms in the cap the abandonment of production thereby promoted and the resulting disappearance of many small and mediumsized farms
conversely we believe it is sensible to coordinate rates of taxation between member states but only by way of minimum regulation and not harmonization
mr president ladies and gentlemen the honorable member has been speaking about the subject of renewable energy and asking what we plan to do to achieve our joint targets
i hardly think so i would therefore call for this generous scheme to be adopted without too many disadvantages being created for german artists who are in fact used to always receiving five
the commission has recently presented a proposal for a european return programmer that is already under discussion in the councils specialized working groups
however it must be endured here that the commission provides the necessary infrastructure so that finding partners does not become an insuperable barrier
there is little agreement in europe concerning the use of nuclear energy and renewable forms of energy in particular
it is clear that that sector has to make a major effort to achieve the agreed standards for twenty twenty
i can tell you today that for the operational programming of the tenth european development fund i would put the number of member states that have decided to take part in joint programming at about ten and even they will not take part in all the programming arrangements
the to does not take into account the massive potential of these countries and their resources
enlargement will unite us with economies that have lower incomes than the present member states but which have greater growth potential
the proposal to initiate a gradual phrasing out of the derogation scheme in order to arrive at the same result by twenty ten may theoretically seem reasonable in terms of effectiveness it would however conflict with the principle of allowing local industry a period of time because it is less competitive due to its production costs which have been proved to be higher
i think that it is important that the commission and the council demand that this submarine goes back to the united kingdom and that they ensure that safety standards are complied with
you reacted and then germany france and the united kingdom also issued a communication without consulting each other as if europe did not exist
this is embedded in everything that has to do with agenda two thousand including proposals for policy change institutional change and the whole of the financial framework
a great many europeans are not opposed to a united europe nor are they opposed to further integration within the
there are positive reports coming from almost all the different markets
they will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages
yet the concept of one country two systems still applies in the areas of human rights democracy and freedom of speech
p t mr president in the midst of the economic and social crisis which is having terrible effects on employment and peoples living conditions i am sorry to say that this draft community budget for twenty ten does not go nearly far enough it does not even take account of either the financial perspectives which suggested eleven of the communitys gross national income or the draft submitted and approved at first reading in this budget which was for one hundred and eight of community gin
consequently there is a long way still to go
when one looks at the title of this document one is inclined to assume that many members of the public would at the sight of it switch off on the grounds that they regard the law on noncontractual obligations as difficult but it is the european issue par excellence something to which most european motorists have given thought at least once and along these lines i am from country a am travelling through country b and meet with an accident involving a driver from country century who may well have a person from country d travelling with him
as has been mentioned the eus member states are losing out on billions of errors of tax revenue every year because of failures in the exchange of information between the member states
we want to ensure that some of the things that are important to us are achieved and i am sure that you will take that into account firstly the model of a social market economy must be the basis of our common policy in europe in other words freedom and responsibility and not just the freedom which was to be found on the financial markets
we now conduct dialogues with around twenty five partner countries
let us remember chernobyl
i have already said what needs to be said about the analysis method
we therefore propose that any initiative in the framework of communitylevel maritime transport safety at least initiatives that we feel are relevant and necessary should form part of the framework of cooperation between the member states without infringing on their sovereign powers
equally they are unable to deal with the special needs of children from problematic socioeconomic backgrounds and disturbed situations
therefore it can be regarded as an appropriate financing instrument
it is a great honour for me to be here with you particularly as you elected a new president yesterday
the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in european women as we have heard is one in ten and it is the biggest killer of women between the ages of thirty five to fifty nine and the second biggest overall
secondly we welcome the fact that suppliers are forming new structures and we call on the commission in its capacity as the competition authority in collaboration with the national mergers and monopolies commissions to ensure that new monopolies do not emerge that new suppliers have free access to the grid that exchanges are set up and that consumers can change their supplier
norway has tacked this problem with a policy of containment rather than slaughter and the question must be asked whether consideration should be given in the european union to alternative methods of combating the disease
i do think that this is as a whole a respectable budget and i again ask the commission to see to it that what was decided by the council and parliament is also implemented in two thousand and three
in short we need to establish a single legal framework that brings together all the community regulations on fisheries and that includes all the measures on modernizing and renewing fleets joint ventures processing and marketing socioeconomic measures aquaculture etcetera
however we must be in a position to do both we must be prepared for both and that is exactly the direction that european policy is going in
in my view these amendments will make the directive far more workable and more acceptable to temporary workers agencies and user companies
and we are talking of two five hundred employees i have nothing else to say
no additional costs must be involved for small and mediumsized businesses
these are therefore no ordinary economic guidelines
unfortunately there was not much to celebrate
parliament i am sure is ready to follow you in this matter
it is important for the country to maintain the momentum and to continue the work it has begun
only through an active approach to the struggle for peace in the balkans can europe achieve stability and security
the labour party heartlands of scotland have sent them an unmistakable message
these principles underpin the stability and growth pact and this pact must be respected and must function properly
there are compromise motions that we are putting forward which we can vote on tomorrow and indeed we are meant to
those farms are well run they provide churches schools and hospital treatment in those areas the communities come together
the common position made the procedure more rigorous effectively introducing more stringent limit values
it is clear and i agree with my colleagues who pointed this out that the present legal status which was forced upon kosovo is totally unacceptable and that it must therefore be rejected by the union quite unambiguously
here too it is for the commission to take responsibility for ensuring that no indirect impact is envisaged here
the management approach will enable our companies to report publicly with the same structure used internally thereby reducing the burden of reporting
i wish to thank mr brief for the commitment and enthusiasm he has invested in this report and would appeal to him not to withdraw his name from it because he did a very good job of work along with the other shadow rapporteurs and myself
i will be happy to endorse this important report which has been painstakingly prepared by my fellow member mr swoboda as well provided that the compromise amendments reflect a balanced and realistic approach
in economic and social terms the our area is definitely the strongest region in the world it is only being made politically weaker by policy makers who are implementing policies aimed at damping down national debate in the short term
in particular with regard to things like audiovisual we had a discussion today in parliament on the randzioplath report on transparency and financial dealings between undertakings and state aid
the planned winning of the agencys role relates to supporting the commission in monitoring environmental impact and in producing reports disseminating information on environmental research and setting up a repository of environmental information
i agree with the ideas expressed by the country holding the eu council presidency and by the commissioner nevertheless i would like to highlight several points
less are important for developing intelligent transport systems itss because itss can provide more efficient cleaner and safer transport solutions and proper implementation of a number of its services requires fully operational less systems
there are powerful economic and geostrategic interests supplying this machinery of war
subject protection of children on foreign exchange schemes from abuse
the eu is using an export ban to act as the health missionary of the entire world
da we are abstaining from voting on the overall report by the committee on fisheries because even though the committees report is an improvement upon the commissions proposals we are of the view that in general the committees report is in favour of the further development of the aquaculture sector in the eu
this report assists in creating an eu crossborder standard which could provide for an improved supply into and across the eu so that such families of individuals needing organs can be more easily met with the hope of relieving their conditions
he is ill in bed but you will be glad to know he will be with us again shortly
the country has been modernized and democratize
mr president mr presidentinoffice of the council mr president of the commission ladies and gentlemen twice this summer europe and the world have faced major crises
i therefore call on commissioner all who i know is very willing to table a commission proposal incorporating our positions as soon as possible so as to allow this house to approve the regulation on closing
we have been at the forefront of the work to ensure openness and better management in the commission and we now come to put our own house parliament in order
there is a need to invest in the longer term in the eu for example by adopting agricultural policies and budgetary frameworks valid for between seven and ten years ahead the current cuts are hard to reconcile with the development of agriculture and efforts to improve competitiveness
typically engaged in maternity and their usual role of supporting other family members women are undoubtedly disadvantages in an agricultural context
the new legal base which was not really what we wanted relies on the european unions competence on health and it must not restrict the scope of the daphne programmer
i believe that with such a lack of determination we are surely not going to succeed in implementing this directive and even less in getting the environmental protection results we want
lastly let me conclude with the parliamentary dimension
all international adoption applications are systematically rejected
is the council prepared to increase food aid food aid is also a very important matter now as this crisis rages and it seems to me that we should devote more attention to this
i invite you to see the results in the second edition of the scoreboard
i apologies in advance for having to leave early i think i have caught a strasbourg cold
mr president i too wish to condemn assault by the israeli defence forces on the jericho prison
i am sure that the presidentinoffice of the council is prepared to answer everything but i must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers
this regulation on environmental economic accounts is very important as has been said here more than once because at last it establishes a statutory basis for a system of accounts integrating environmental and economic statistics that is crucial for environmental policy and in the broader context social policy
the commission continues to monitor the internal situation in myanmar carefully but apart from the freeing of hung san suu by in july last year there has been no sign of significant improvement in respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms or of any steps taken towards the restoration of democracy
however let us not lose sight of the importance of the issue as mr schulz has said of the international system as a whole on the multilateral approach and effectiveness
i would like you to tell me mr kyprianou in no uncertain terms will mon eight hundred and sixty three be assessed
here is where it began
the european commission therefore has a responsibility for studying anticipating and planning in relation to the consequences of climate change which is not just an issue for great political speeches during great debates but which has immediate and at times dramatic consequences for the economy of the countries as we can see in this case
in order to achieve that the commission is currently drafting a white paper on this subject and i hope that the white paper will give us the necessary basis on which to establish common rules and hence make it possible to impose requirements on the matter in specific environmental legislation
lucid needs to support concrete measures that help to find solutions to the less development needs to combat poverty and to ensure a decent income and existence
we are here to move things forward and i feel that it is in our interests to improve relations with the member states
this is not our case and therefore i trust you
es mr president mrs schauvliege commissioner i would like to start by saying that i felt that both speeches by the presidentinoffice of the council and the commissioner gave a very different perspective on the cancún conference to their perspective on the copenhagen conference
parliaments delegation for relations between the european union and urine is in permanent contact with those concerned and is prepared to help
i regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all member states
as i hope i made clear in my introductory statement the keys to improving the functioning of the oil markets are better conditions for investment greater market transparency and in particular better data improved energy efficiency and the development of alternative technologies
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is a core principle of the eu and its policies and it is something that we all strongly care about and support
this certainly holds true for the conflict in the middle east
the vote will take place during the next partsession
we need to be very clear about that
we all know that there are different viewpoints on these issues and that the european community has been many times on the defensive side of a dispute over such measures
it is important to ensure that the initiative is as citizenfriendly and straightforward as possible without encouraging its misuse
the three multiannual guidance programmes have all failed to allow member states to reduce their fishing fleets
firstly this excerpt from a statement made by the german union of survivors of the neuengamme concentration camp
reducing gas emissions from air traffic which cause the greenhouse effect and setting the exact upper limit for emissions after twenty twelve are crucial
i was in turkey ten days ago and while i was there i spoke to members of the new turkish government and the new parliament
first significant reductions of fishing opportunities in shallower waters due to depletion of stocks and the extension of the national jurisdictions under the united nations convention on the law of the sea in the nineteen seventies
it was our group that introduced the amendments relating to the trading book we see it as a very good thing that the good and fast work done by the commission has now made it possible for these to be adopted in the course of the voting on basel i i thus ensuring consistent implementation in this area
we are faced with a question about the philosophy of the eus fight against illegal immigration and let us put it simply also against restrictions on legal immigration does fronted have to bear the brunt of this fight
that offense is comprehensive and will extend to possession of child pornography as well as its production distribution sale or other forms of trafficking
it is high time to set the right priorities
we continue to stand by our current system of the collective management of quotas by member states and the professional fisheries organizations
we emphasis that future industrial growth in the european union is dependent on our openness to foreign trade and investment governed by fair rules but that our competitiveness with the area countries is up to us by improving our own levels of education training research enterprise and innovation
thus the first solution proposed by the letting members of the house to reduce the number of bogus asylum seekers was to open up our borders more and to take in such people as legal immigrants
in malta the importers of medicinal products and the nationalist parliamentary secretary have agreed to reduce the price of sixty three medicinal products
we demand a referendum on any change to the lisbon treaty so the irish people will have the opportunity to resist being turned into fulltime serfs of the financial markets
one of the most controversial issues in this debate is the question of thresholds
the reassertion of the intangible character of the common rules decided would have been more useful than the triumphant tiresome declarations of various heads of state at the end of the european council
secondly for the first time agriculture taken as a whole has now become clean and green this can certainly be attributed to the substantial simplification efforts of recent years
the council has asked me to reverse the order of the two items scheduled for wednesday morning the proposal is that we first hold the debate on the situation in iraq in the presence of lord bach and then the joint debate on climate change
and now on top of that national debt we are expected to contribute to these european recovery programmes
we must also reiterate our condemnation of those countries which hypocritically hail human rights but do not hesitate to carry on selling arms to a regime guilty of genocide
i entirely agree with all those who have talked today about the need to pursue a policy of peace by economic means as well and to remove the socioeconomic causes of instability and i think that this is a field where the european union is already doing a great deal for the outside world
i would like to reiterate that here at this point because of the ecopoint system the lorries on the roads in southern germany and northern italy are more modern than the ones the republic of austria itself has licensed in its own country because it does not use the ecopoint system
the first concerns our requirement for the commission to fulfill its role with respect to the new resources at its disposal and to the entry into force of the charter of fundamental rights the situation of the roam people has sadly been the first practical case and the commission has in the end only gone halfway on this matter basing itself solely on the free movement directive
i support this report because it highlights the importance of initiatives such as the black sea synergy and the eastern partnership
we need a more targeted approach to the choice of legislative instruments which in addition to the institution would give the president of the european council the mandate to coordinate the relaunch of the single market in close cooperation with the president of the commission
a credit card format will not be able to accommodate all the official orders and data so the supplementary document also needs to be normative in nature
in actual fact what is at stake are crucial issues firstly the reference to the european lobby in the text that is annoyed and not in the legislative part secondly the intention to award grants for operational needs and not for specific actions thirdly financing and degressivity rates must be identical both for the european lobby and for other organizations operating at european level
the conditions for accession to the eu – and not to europe as the resolution states – raise similar problems to the accession of other countries albeit with some peculiar characteristics
the work of nos in the country is problematic and thus virtually nonexistent
it is also unsatisfactory because it rules out decision by parliament
we will all benefit from the commitment of a strong korea to the support announced at the millennium round of the world trade organization
mr president ladies and gentlemen the issue of labour mobility and the mobility of students is very important for my country slovakia as well as for other new members of the union
fourthly additional adverse consequences for the economic situation such as the rapporteur fears might be brought about by increased expenditure on the armed forces and on internal security can be drastically minimized by a sensible policy of development which would focus on removing such causes of terrorism as poverty oppression exploitation and cultural intolerance
the commission goes from one compromise to the next awarding a cheque to some a tip to others and some compensation here and there which may be more or less depending on the products people individual situations climates and policies the commission is discrediting the european union by acting in this manner but it will be the farmers the guardians and managers of the land who will pay for it
let us see the commission put its money where its mouth is and allow parliament adequate time to legislate on the proposals which let us remember the commission is desperate to have but has not yet formally put forward
on the other hand there is a regrettable tendency at national and european level to say there must be a balance between what people put in and what people get out
speaking of dairy products a sector that is quite crucial to the adores i cannot accept a situation in which farmers live in a state of constant fear of being fined for overproduction while european criminal organizations are falsifying tens of thousands of tons of butter with the complicity of the major european dairy product groups and while the dairy industry is receiving subsidies for powdered milk which is basically whey while major dairy produce companies are selling the equivalent of hundreds of millions of livres of what purport to be dairy products but are in fact counterfeit products that are not made from milk nor can i accept that the commission has had very little or nothing to say on this issue
the nature of the refugee question has for a wide variety of reasons changed since nineteen fifty one the year in which the geneva convention on refugees came into being
it gives no precise commitment for a framework directive on public services
that is something we need to have the courage to change in this europe
i understand this
before we take a vote on this issue we want to be sure what the true position of the commission is
the memory of the large effort made by our country the work of the citizens but also of the politicians and the civil service aimed at adapting to the exacting standards of the european union is still fresh in our minds
in this context the commissions announcement that it intends to submit an amended proposal has gained extensive support in the council as i think the commissioner will elaborate shortly
we must first allow it to act and develop before judging its effectiveness
also it is important that the amsterdam treaty takes into account the new rules on comitology
it is focused by the use growth and investment strategy agreed by social democratic governments across europe
there is agreement in principle on this issue which i welcome but the member states must make this modest financial commitment if the foundation is to get off the ground
mrs neytsuyttebroeck is no longer an me

mr president commissioner piebalgs whilst we know that heating and cooling account for nearly half of the energy consumption in the european union nothing has been done about a more efficient use of energy

mr prone i have answered your question
f r madam president president arroyo has set us an ambitious target for the production of renewable energy with a view to reducing greenhouse gas emissions without hindering our prospects of growth
i think that the presidency is right not to discuss the merits of each individual issue for the issues will of course be reflected upon and discussed during the conference itself i believe on the other hand that it is right to take on board the general sense of direction and the suggestions relating to transparency first and foremost and from this point of view i can assure you that the presidency will make every endeavour to ensure the participation of the entire european public not least by setting up a special web site
i would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely once again for her truly splendid work
the challenges that we in europe will have to take up and overcome together in the twenty-first century will of course lie at the heart of the declaration
are they or are they not implemented in every member state
will you commit to a competitive market that allows producers a fair share of the cake and will you commit to a functional milk market that gives a fair deal to farmers and a fair price to consumers
time to move up a gear creating a europe of entrepreneurship and growth vote
presidentinoffice of the council p t naturally i took note of your concerns and comments but i am here as the representative of the council the council as such is not empowered to comment on the subject of the intergovernmental conference where the member states sit round a table to discuss given items precisely in their capacity as member states that is independent sovereign states acting completely independently as member states
the question of quotas is what makes the report controversial but for a healthy european culture and cultural diversity quotas are necessary
ninetynine per cent of european companies are small and mediumsized these employ sixty six per cent of workers and generate fifty five per cent of turnover
south africa exercises strong political influence over the mugabe government and south africa must show strong and decisive leadership on this issue for the people of zimbabwe and also for the people of africa who are having to watch this leader lead his country down into the swamp
i am delighted that the commissioner on behalf of the european commission has expressed a similar view and i hope that this view is also shared by the council of ministers even though the seats reserved for the council are empty as i see they are
some members of the house including the last questioner have drawn attention to the importance of retaining this aid and preserving jobs in tobacco growing
we voted against the text and the amendments as a whole
it is unfortunate that the procedure has been prolonged but the result permits in particular a first important step in the reinforcement of the communitys consumer protection services
i have committed myself fully to increasing and improving these interrelationships with regard to the management of our programmer i am convinced that in this way the execution of actions in the field of energy will be carried out in a way which is coherent with the different community instruments

this while the chinese leader is currently on a glorious tour of the european union
es mr president my group simply wants to highlight that the current budgetary and financial framework for two thousand and seven to twenty thirteen makes it very difficult to respond effectively to the new political priorities
mrs rise spoke of the need to turn the military withdrawal we have seen in recent days into a political success expressing sentiments reiterated by mr portas
what signals will this special summit send out
the aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility
because once a person is infected that cannot be reversed
that degree of consensus is not arrived at easily it requires hard work and i should like to congratulate harald tell for the success of that work

a european action plan with objectives with strategies in which the improvement of fast intervention within the necessary time window as is done in road safety could perhaps help us and also improve working conditions and training for professionals
the commission is doing what it can and is delivering on it

secondly we must emphasis the bilateral nature of these agreements
this would give the member states engaged in industrial fishing the opportunity to solve within their own fishing industry the conflict between industrial fishing and fishing for consumption which has seen a shift to community level
moreover the struggle against climate change offers europe an excellent opportunity to increase new technologies and create new jobs in order to promote energy security

first the committee would like a clear statement by the commission on the future energy policys effects on the environment standards of living and the quality of life in individual member states second the committee wishes to emphasize the importance of the commission doing more on eu initiatives on renewable energy sources

this is a laudable aim but european citizens will be the only beneficiaries
this is also outlined in the nineteen ninety seven report on respect for human rights in the european union
but i should also like to say that we very much regret that the commission was unfortunately not on our side from the outset on the points we were calling for and on which the council finally gave way
in short i believe that keeping written records represents value for money and i am in favour of written archives in addition to video recordings

we have been elected by the citizens of europe and we must use the money raised from them through taxes to first solve their problems and when we have solved their problems then give money to turkey and other countries outside the eu
our own shortcomings cannot however justify our holding ten nations hostage as we struggle with the council nor can they justify our slamming the door against the prospective entrants

b g mr president dear colleagues i would like to draw your attention to an issues that makes us responsible for the future of the european union and the world at large this is the trafficking in children

we proved that we can reach a consensus at that time and again now
we urgently call upon the belarusian authorities to allow political opposition civil society free expression and media pluralism the rule of law needs to be adhered to
because homelessness is part of a complex multidimensional pattern of disadvantage it requires a coordinated approach from public authorities an approach which is sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the homeless which takes account of the fact that homeless people need jobs schools and health services and an income as well as a home
and they are institutions not institutions
– mr president an effort is being made to use an insipid wishlist about the development of tourism and environmental protection in order to bring tourism more into line with the antiworking class lisbon strategy
five members of our group went the whole distance all of the five hundred and thirty kilometres mrs buitenweg mr turned mr boatman mr mayor and i would like to thank you for the support
we are aware of the fact that according to scientific studies these substances are likely to have a devastating effect on the hormonal system at extremely low levels
the commission will pay careful attention to the correct implementation of the directive for this purpose my services have already met the national delegations asking for explanations in this connection and are available for further meetings
conservative mess can therefore support the compromise proposal as an exception and in no way setting a precedent
both parties in the conflict must be convinced that violence is of course not the solution
they are two different things while the community body aims for a harmonies systematic collection of general statistics from various states with the public and administrations as its main clients who therefore provide it with work the observatory has more specific and focused objectives according to the market and the statistical requirements of firms and professionals
i would thank the commission for the increased counting from those who make use of the agreement so that there is less of a burden on our taxpayers but i regret the fact that the agreement is being extended to include several tones per year
the very opposite is the case in switzerland where all the things i have listed remain in place and only controls on persons are to cease
parliament is responsible because it must be clear about the current imperfections and must accept the reforms
it would be possible to implement and it would be justified and proportionate
and therefore since mention has even been made of markets competition and a possible shift of sales outlets from the european to the american continent i feel duty bound to say that above all else this is a question of justice
monitoring should be more concerned with results what has been achieved with funding and how
such companies have the financial means to buy patents and build up vast portfolios this allows them to market some of their inventions whilst blocking the development of others

never before did so many countries nos and journalists take part in a un conference
in my opinion that government has not only failed to assume its responsibilities but has given in to the israeli government
of all the aforesaid the most worrying aspect is the impasse in institutional matters with the risk that decisions are taken at the last minute with no transparency whatsoever and without citizens being informed in advance
on the spanish milk quota in nineteen eighty nine the commission does not have a legal base to change the decision this is also the position of the court of justice
these were to have been fully implemented by two thousand and three and we are attempting right now to make up for this failure

mr president two azerbaijani youth activists and sluggers min abdullayev and adnan hajizade have been sentenced to two and a half years and two years respectively in an unfair trial
it is something that we will see evolving as time goes by
it may at times however be easier for the large institutions than for the small ones to make savings i think that is something we must look at and we must of course also check carefully that interinstitutional cooperation pays dividends
for years we have been calling for improvements in freedom of religion but far too little progress has been made
credibility i am aware of the difficulties and delays that have come to light in a number of areas
also i should like to thank the president of the commission who through his enthusiasm and good judgement helped make this outcome possible
i need not remind you that the union imports no less than fifty of plasmaderived therapeutic products and that haemophiliacs patients suffering from serious burns and other patients desperately need these products
i do not believe that the state of stocks and the current scandalous system of discards are a good example of the policy s effectiveness which must therefore in my opinion be significantly improved
that is all i was referring to
mr president you have come to the european parliament at a crucial time in the relationship between sera and montenegro and the european union – and indeed in some senses at a defining time for sera and montenegro themselvesthe new union soon to be made up of twenty five member states has been looking forward with hope and expectation at the process of reform and change in your country and in the wider region over the past few years
it cannot be governed by market forces and competition alone
it provides that soil should form an integral part of climate policy
there comes a time when we have to stop routinely nodding things through like clockwork monkeys in a tired charade of parliamentary scrutiny
in nineteen ninety three under a new decision procedure legislative powers were allocated to parliament and the council on an almost equal footing
p l mr president i think the elections on twenty nine november are an opportunity for honduras and the european parliament is obliged to send observers to the elections this would not be to legitimate them as the left are saying because that would be illegal but to see how the elections are conducted
the regulation of procedural issues has been left within the framework of the other proposal which is pending in the committee on civil liberties justice and home affairs and is being processed by our honorable friend and rapporteur díaz de mere
idealistic as this may sound i have received a great deal of support from both the commission and the representatives of the act regions and despite the many concerns expressed by nos and political groups they and i and i am sure the commission remain optimistic
looking back over this parliamentary term it is clear that of all the european institutions it is the european parliament which has done most to expose real and fundamental problems of mismanagement fraud and nepotism
why talk to a negotiator who cannot move at all and has no flexibility how are we going to resolve this
b five hundred and two million, two hundred and sixty two thousand and one by mrs maijweggen and mr possess on behalf of the group of the european people s party christian democrats and european democrats on the violence in indonesia especially in kalimantan
it is also an acknowledgement of the rein status of the united kingdom
however i feel that we should not talk about this purely in the context of the financial crisis because even once a normal economic cycle has been restored the issue of energy efficiency will remain
i would first like to address the question from mr de jong who asked me whether i was discouraged about not being in a position as the president of the court of auditors to give a positive das my answer would be that as an auditor i would be delighted to give such an opinion when the time came but it is not the job of auditors to be happy with the opinions that they give
much advertising goes well beyond the erotic to the pornographic with overtones of violence and sadism this advertising cheaper all women
the next item is the continuation of the debate on the councils statement on the situation in kosovo which was suspended prior to the vote
the georgian parliament and ombudsman are actively monitoring this
how long is this to continue
why do we treat israel differently
we understand them and we also understand the irish political situation that has been created in the irish parliament and what efforts are being made on this difficult path
finally i know that mr bushillmatthews intends to table an oral amendment to amendment five to place emphasis upon the need to retain older people in the workforce
there are therefore many points on which we can reassure them
i think that splitting the foreign affairs council from the general affairs council is as mr correct has just said the right starting point on the administrative side
however parliaments reasoning is not very clear
probably for the first time i support the proposal made by mr panders for continued dialogue within the parliamentary committee on certain matters that bind us to our moroccan colleagues it is a recently created committee which can be supported why not by a group of friends from morocco because there are a lot of them here
then i would like to say something briefly about sexual harassment
it deals with the issue of the lisbon european council which had the objective of making the european union the most competitive and dynamic knowledgebased economy in the world and link that to the fire council which endorsed a european charter for small enterprises
but we are only going to be able to develop a full and successful response if we get the cooperation of all parties both in the union outside the union and of course in the commercial services
i also have some technical corrections and precisions to make
these clearing houses should enable us to reduce systemic risks and we must be very careful to ensure that they can succeed by establishing all the conditions they require to perform that role
i was delighted to hear you confirm commissioner that you have two studies not just one looking at this issue in depth
having said that it is impossible for me to take any pleasure in it when in the same text and before the process parliament totally alters the registration procedure for two thirds of the substances concerned by reach those of less than ten tones tests reduced in the extreme and depending on risk and not tonnage in my opinion this does not afford even basic safeguards with regard to health and safety for the people most at risk
only at the final stage did the european commission decide to propose the unrealistic deadline of twenty fourteen
it must be peoplefriendly
the summer report is crucial not only for giving consumers clear information but also for avoiding distortion of the market and acting as a catalyst for the european economy through transparent mechanisms and the uniform application of rules within the eu
nor does it just have to do with occupational retirement provision
more justly it would be germany and her french collaborator because running the our according to german interests is the root of this shambles
mr president ladies and gentlemen climate policy is a process that will inform everything we do in the twentyfirst century and i trust that europe will continue to play a leading role here
we have fifty years of experience of a simple limit on the west coast of sweden and more recently in the baltic sea
what is more this idea of low carbon technology is simply wrong
now i agree with those who stated that the council did not act appropriately with the european parliament but i believe that the message sent out by the committee on civil liberties justice and home affairs last week taught the council a lesson a lesson that was clearly understood
six months have been more than sufficient for europe to have realized that your presidencyinoffice and your government are a faulty model
we see them imposing embargos on iraq where they have killed thousands of children we saw them in yugoslavia together with their friends on this side of the atlantic killing civilians flattening infrastructures and destroying the environment
the references to anonymous sources predicting an apocalyptic report of the commission for bulgaria in july even before it has started writing it are suggestions for domestic political purposes only but they do not contribute to the resolution of problems
every year the commission provides full information on administrative expenditure it is ready to discuss with the budgetary authority any alternative presentation to ensure transparency on this expenditure
the new proposal aims at dating the following decisions extending the monitoring past the year two thousand to take into account community emissions limitations and reductions after the year two thousand extending monitoring to a greater number of greenhouse gases c o two not being the only gas concerned
they have as you have outlined made significant efforts to meet european norms and we should not blow this one incident out of all proportion
fourth energy policy needs more focus and the nabucco project is a step in the right direction
all this means the croatian government needs to show further signs of respect for democratic principles
it is not an acceptable state of affairs and i call on you to reassure the house on this day of linguistic freedom that this regrettable situation will be remedies as soon as possible and that it will not arise again when the next two new member states join the eu in the near future
the review will therefore provide an opportunity to reaffirm my support for origin marking and clarify this issue once and for all as it is an essential instrument for the competitiveness of european companies and the health of eu citizens
the european union operates under a system known as is which is the international accountancy standards system
will the commission say
we now have no choice but to strictly obey our time limits
i voted for this report because it is important that we develop a tool which can complement gap taking into account that it has to be done in a way so that it can have practical use based on clearly defined indicators and highquality data this report calls on the commission to submit a tiered strategy for the beyond gap approach which should explain how the new approach can be used pragmatically in daytoday political activities
what measures have been taken to ensure that even this minimal funding will in fact lead to the establishment of the land registry
many indonesians and certainly their rulers and their military still regard the fact that they made this split impossible as a great success
we believe that in the future too the lisbon strategy must be based on the need for social policy economic policy and environmental policy mutually to support each other
de mr president commissioner mr lindblad ladies and gentlemen i would like to pick up on the call made by mr garriga for realistic budgets
and that will provide much stronger tools and infrastructure to carry out the tests next time in a more unified rigorous and coherent manner so i want to underline this point
it is still too vague
as regards the commission position with respect to the amendments tabled by parliament i would like to confirm what my colleagues stated during the debate held in this house on monday evening
president bouteflika has taken steps towards opening up algeria
our project of a europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the structural funds
integration in this area can for that reason only be achieved by means of coercion
certain scientists believe that another cause for this phenomenon is the electromagnetic wave radiation emitted from mobile phones which penetrated the bees navigation system leaving them unable to return to the hive
n l madam president i thank mr states for his question
this part of the report commissioner vitorino was related by the committee and what remains is therefore the possibility of confiscating crimerelated proceeds
that report has been published
i also think we should increasingly develop and rationalize our relations with the whole of latin america
i should like to congratulate mr covered on this annual report and on the new system that he has introduced
reducing the driving time to eight hours would therefore unjustifiably increase the competitive disadvantage that drivers from these countries face in relation to hauliers from the more centrally located member states
that is strange to say the least
i think that the focus should be on children health and not on agricultural economics
secondly a belgian proposal for a programmer to encourage exchanges and training for persons in charge of measures to counter trafficking in human beings
as far as we are concerned this is not the main priority we already have comparable data from other countries
this now requires an opinion from your parliament as well as from the european commission and the central bank
regarding the financial perspectives i have already made a commitment to putting forward the proposal for a specific kind of eurobond our project eurobonds and even though i have already heard some negative comments from some capitals i am still hopeful that this will come into being
unless europe speaks with a single voice it will be impossible to continue working closely with the united states on an ongoing basis while retaining our dignity
it is also important that the european parliament has a major influence on what is contained in article thirteen in practice
motion for a resolution b five hundred and three million, three hundred and twelve thousand by mr figueiredo and others on behalf of the guengl group on the outcome of the extraordinary european council in lisbon on twenty three and twenty four march
these are nonnegotiable rights for the european union
at the same time people over the age of eighty who made up thirty six of the population in two thousand are likely to make up six in twenty twenty five and ten in twenty fifty
mr president over the last few weeks we have heard and read a lot about the alleged use of european airspace airports and countries by the united states in its global war on terror so i welcome this debate it allows this parliament to discuss one of the fundamental issues facing european governments and institutions in the twenty-first century the balance to be struck between security and liberty in a world characterized in part by masscasualty terrorism
my sincere congratulations to you mr presidentinoffice on your success your major success in leading the european union to agreement on a common position in brussels on seventeen february
commissioner ladies and gentlemen when putting together the budget of the european parliament we must focus on our core mission and make optimal use of resources for improving the legislative work of parliament
otherwise we shall strain at a gnat and swallow a camel and public health will suffer as a result
we should bear in mind that this discussion is not about old versus new member states
mr president it was significant that when the president of the commission spoke to us this morning he talked about the russian crisis and not the overall problem that we face in the global economy that is a very worrying sign for the european union
in the second place you also mentioned safeguarding the european social model reiterating the conclusions of the lisbon summit which we feel are a move in the right direction the direction of defending the trio of employment social cohesion and competitively i shall take the liberty mr president of adding two further fundamental questions to this agenda
today i voted against the amended proposal and legislative resolution on reach because as the votes progressed amendments to ease the burden on sees were generally lost
i also agree with view that forty one of community gap – forty five if we include the resources for rural development – ought really to be regarded as a minimum for an effective cohesion policy
the main aim should be the protection of the health and safety of consumers
sweden has already introduced this and to a large degree it is operating well
so the press the commission and the european parliament all knew about it but did not say a word
that is one of the difficulties in developing a european model where to a large extent the social partners have to take the blame for initiatives in industrial relations
what the voters think about economic policy when it comes to general elections however will no longer be of interest
unnecessary internal irritation is far from constructive
however as many speakers have mentioned – for which i am grateful – it is also important to bear in mind that the issue of nuclear programmer is not the only one that is important and fundamental to our relationship with that country and which must be resolved if we are to improve our relations with its government with its president
centralized supervision could lead to increased transparency in the world of credit rating agencies and could promote greater competition between the different agencies
on behalf of my electors in lava i also support those facilitations connected with travel from russia to the european union for this is very important in circumstances such as a familys ability to come together as in lava there are many mixed families and relatives where some live in one country and some in the other
it is now for the member states to implement this provision as swiftly as possible so as to reinvigorate those companies that are still in difficulties today as the commissioner and a number of my fellow members have emphasized
in conclusion i can say quite honestly that everything has been resolved but it took one and a half years of work to do so i should very much like once again to thank all those who have helped
we might also say that there are very good grounds for bringing in this directive now even though it is rather less comprehensive in its legal scope than before
they should enter into talks with all parties and europe should play an important role in this just as the united states did in northern ireland
a safety net funded by taxpayers is guaranteed to increase aggressive speculative foreign policy in the financial sector and promote the worst of capitalism
the commission has many ways of ensuring that consumers and european citizens are protected against a possible food crisis
the tillichmulder procedure i will say this quite explicitly is not meant to make the management of agricultural expenditure resided
finally mr president i would also like to point out the great opportunities which the information society gives us to decentralise employment
that is why the commission supports a limited change to article one hundred and thirty six of the treaty
we agreed to reject the commercial campaign mounted by the pharmaceutical companies
i voted against the report when item fifteen was voted down by the political left with two hundred and sixty six votes in favour of doing so and two hundred and thirty seven votes against
rapporteur f r mr president mr presidentinoffice commissioner ladies and gentlemen today we are about to vote on a second private international law instrument the future regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations which is that rare thing in community law a document on a purely legal issue
i am happy to be able to inform you that we accept more than half of the amendments of the committee on fisheries which greatly reinforce our proposal and which we will readily defend in the council
there is no work the welfare of the world has to depend on work and on hope for development whereby people can rediscover themselves and if the technological innovation produced by the information revolution also brings an increasing number of jobs europe will be able to compete on culture education professionalism sport tourism environment services the structuring of the territory and the development of public and private works geared to transport energy and telecommunications infrastructure
that is why it is key for us to establish our priorities here and to make a start on demarcation the various competences
n l there is no common public opinion in europe
these are the kind of questions that arise
when we have received it we will produce a letter giving a reasoned opinion
mr president let me say for the sake of clarity that i have voted against the gröner report not because i am opposed to gender equality which is far from being the case but because this report and the institute for gender equality to which it refers are typical of the suffocating political correctness which is gradually tightening its grip on europe
the impact of a duty on the price of such shoes is therefore potentially greater than it is for ordinary shoes
the risk is that these price instruments might only delay the synchronisation of supply and demand because the market does not highlight the incentives sufficiently
the biggest and most important of all was the us summit which took place in county clare
i will raise that matter with the president
i believe that the report tabled by mrs balzani is a workable compromise
unfortunately we can do nothing for those who have disappeared apart from extending our condolences to their families indeed there is very little we can do to predict other earthquakes
i should also like to highlight the need for the commission to extend its process of improving the procedures as regards the partnership agreements more specifically the process of monitoring and implementing those agreements
recently the commission published the sixth report on serious infringements of the rules of the common fisheries policy
like mrs dybkjær i believe that the common position gives us this consistency i do not see any point in the amendments which mr annoyed is tabling
you will see because this is not necessarily our last disaster this request will become increasingly popular in coastal communities
we should also help to sort out the accounting clearance problem we voted wrongly in this regard
but i can assure you of one thing at first reading both the committee and parliament endured that a balance remained in place between buyers sellers and manufacturers
the union is closely monitoring developments in the urine and recognizes ukraines achievements over recent years in establishing itself as an independent democratic european country with a market economy
we have been shocked but the commission has been getting questions on this problem for a long time
therefore it is not one way but a today process
in conclusion mr president a few words about the exemplary role that european institutions could play in this
likewise i think we must draw up detailed terms and conditions for an air name to be removed from the list
the main question that arises is whether it can be implemented as much now needs to be done in order to achieve what the document claims is essential bearing in mind the political direction that the european union has been taking
i would ask each and every member who cares about it to contact their group leaders and tell them what they think because i am stuck with the agenda as i find it when i take over the chair and i do not enjoy it
we need to set up specialist centres responsible for protecting children and adolescents at risk so as to prevent and identify all forms of sexual abuse and we need also to provide them with all the necessary medical psychological and legal assistance
in that respect it should be emphasized that the introduction of new policies and the enhancement of powers already recognised throughout the union such as the results of the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon have made it plainer than ever that an adequate budget is needed
these matters are to be assessed and analyzed in the manner which i suggested earlier
we should concentrate chiefly on consolidating the european union budget and on cohesion
i refer to the intergovernmental conference the single currency and enlargement
six more applications have been made to mobilize the solidarity fund corresponding to the closure of hundreds more companies in europe altogether more than three zero workers have been made redundant
only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions
the european union is about an ever closer union
we were all horrified by the violent power of this natural disaster and its horrendous consequences
this is a question that we could ask like many others and that is why i believe that we must assess the copenhagen criteria with a degree of indulgence and throw the doors of our europe wide open
the burden of this is borne by the population while the profits are cashed in by various international legal entities whose background is not always clear
this house is characterized by its continuity in that you do not have to agree with every word but every time we have the same problem
everyone agrees that intervention was needed and it is good that the action has been swift this was unavoidable
at the same time the economic crisis engulfing europe which has affected european competitiveness and brought about extensive changes in the financial and economic markets has caused the bankruptcy of whole branches of manufacturing and the loss of many jobs among other things
this directive will be a huge step forward for europe both from the point of view of the quality of its policies and its effectiveness
with this report as a basis the commission should quickly be able to table proposals for a new directive
plant protection products that are particularly harmful must be taken out of circulation and the use of chemicals for this purpose must be significantly reduced
mr title it is absolutely vital that we ensure that these passengers rights are applied
i should like to ask the commission how it intends to follow up on scientific research efforts in this area to intensify these efforts and to translate the results of this research into benefits for people in the light of the europe twenty twenty strategy
a our as strong as it is will require whatever anyone says gradual increases in interest rates
mr president for years somatic has been left to fend for itself by the international community after all there was no credit to be gained
these are multilateral meetings between the commission and the visegrad countries to deal with problems connected with the application of the system visits by community customs experts to the visegrad countries and vice versa and other measures which i could detail and which were detailed in the committee of inquiry
we all want the union to work and we all know it will be judged on its ability to deliver concrete projects for the region
on the one hand while we are to remain vigilant there is thought to be relatively little chance of our competitors turning their lead into actual monopoly positions on the other our proposals are dismissed as an understandable but basically unacceptable attempt by the commission to acquire new powers
although we are often in disagreement i must acknowledge your friendliness as well as the approachability and courtesy of your staff
as has been said we must clarify the called dilemma of the grey area
finally the implementation of the whole of this legal framework was dependent and still is dependent on negotiations with third countries such as switzerland the united states and andorra for the application of equivalent measures and the application of the same measures by the member states in territories dependent on those member states such as the channel islands
you can even hire institutions for it anyway
this does not change anything in substance however
i do not think you said x two that i shall stand for election again
in connection with your question i would like to also point out that i have a certain hope that the extremely marked polarization in the czech republic will prove surmountable
the environmental technology sector offers a very promising challenge in terms of both more jobs and less pressure on the environment
moldovas request only represents a small step but it is at least of some significance
this opens a veritable pandoras box against liberty and promotes the removal of functions from the member states such as the decision over transferral of data about their citizens which is being given to a european judicial public authority
i would stress the fact that the public authorities have a major role to play at regional level as well as national and european level
the next item is the report a four million, fourteen thousand, one hundred and ninety seven by mr baldarelli on behalf of the committee on fisheries on the proposal for a council decision on a specific measure to encourage italian fishermen to diversify out of certain fishing activities com nine hundred and sixty thousand, six hundred and eighty two c four trillion, three billion, seven hundred and ninety seven million, nine hundred and sixty thousand, three hundred and eight cans
it is the most basic common sense also to address other key issues such as the level of payments for next year and the pace of the commission reform
rather in denmark the government is saying that there is nothing of any significance whatsoever in this treaty as it believes that by saying this it can make its citizens believe that they do not need to be allowed to vote on it
former soviet states also need cooperation with the eu a sentiment supported too by joe widen during his recent visit to chişinău
the fifteen fragmented liberalism markets must be merged into a single transparent market and the legislation now before us must create the framework for this
on that eight may a new european geography was drawn up totalitarianism was overcome — at least certain forms of it — but another different kind although equally ironfisted and more lasting took half of europe hostage
having said that the recovery plan may be revised in twenty ten on the basis of new scientific advice or weaknesses detected in its implementation
it is for that reason that we must defend the common european currency and we need it to be a stable one
so maybe we should take time to sit down and think and should not charge like bulls into an easymarket concept
all the speeches we have heard have been interesting but it is difficult for us to speak at a stage which is quite properly secret as you said mr president
therefore it seems important to me for the solidarity fund and the measures that we are taking to be targeted at these longer consequences of natural destruction
this amendment has also been accepted by the committee on budgets and four menu have been earmarked
amongst other things the proposal in paragraph six of mr van volens report concerning a european pact that should include the coordination of economic and financial policy goes too far in our view
i also see a problem in the fact that china has not been invited to the negotiations
i think that this is interestingly innovative and might be an idea for negotiating future fisheries agreements with a similar dimension and equilibrium
i am also pleased that we will achieve legal certainty
so therefore all the major religious traditions have the same potential but they come from different locations and different peoples with different mental dispositions we need different ways of approach
the council authorized the commission to open negotiations with its partners from the mediterranean in two thousand and six with a view to negotiating a proper dispute settlement mechanism
efforts to solve them must be coordinated and shared by all
i will certainly inform president contained
this involves certain requirements as far as training and experience are concerned and calls of course for professional people with the relevant qualifications who are accustomed to discharging the responsibilities associated with the liberal professions in relation to penal civil administrative and professional matters
with regard to the question of the swedish example i am not going to insist on the issue of joint storage
the ha council also agreed the framework decision on drugs
in order to do so we need a number of commitments
in june two thousand and seven the convention and the nonlegally binding recommendation were adopted by the governing body of the international labour organization
the commission applies the current criteria the council would probably be well advised to adjust the balance of these criteria
the matter of partnership of cooperation is very important as was mentioned in particular in mrs mănescus report
there is a commission proposal from december last year i believe which invites the european parliament for an opinion and i would urge you not to block this second track and to produce your opinion as quickly as possible so that something can be done which might produce a tangible effect in the mediterranean
mr president i am from a country with a constitution that shrines the truth about fundamental human rights the truth that they are part of human nature and essential to human dignity the truth that a supreme being not a mere human institution gave these rights to us – all of us without exception
we must also take into account the situation of countries such as poland whose power generation industry is largely based on coal
so please tell me what i should do however i feel that it would be beneath my dignity and this is of course not intended as a criticism of those who are present to complete the procedure in this way
i shall therefore ask the commission and the council to take this matter seriously and to act more consistently
the medina report says that the then commission attempted to hide the truth and to blame parliament for the suspension whereas the decision was actually taken by the commission itself having caved in to pressure from the u k
paragraph thirteen of the schwab report welcomes the fact however i should like to comment that the issues which he touches on in his request are particularly sensitive and his arguments are particularly weak
does the commissioner consider that the fact that president clinton has not for the moment secured those powers from the us congress will somehow mean that he will not secure the necessary powers to modify title i of the helms burton act
just as important a factor is the states ability to deliver development including access to health services
in lava estonia and lithuania over completely innocent children old people women and men were treacherously herded into cattle trucks to be reported to the siberian death camps
the next item is the report by mrs bozkurt on behalf of the committee on womens rights and gender equality on womens role in the social economic and political life in turkey

there will be no point us going to copenhagen with our legislation unless it is accompanied by serious funds next december over to you commission
i have rarely come across a proposal as strange as this this is tantamount to using beelzebub to exorcise the devil
the latest evaluation of the implementation of this budget line which was sent to parliament in july insisted on the strong added value of the concept of decentralised cooperation as a complementary tool for the actions implemented under the national indicative programmes in favour of the local civil society
is it therefore a case of there being no competent women
these simple operations only require very low levels of investment and are therefore in no way a development factor as the court of justice in luxembourg highlights in its ruling on the emesa sugar case in nineteen ninety eight as the only interest is providing easy added value for international operators
on behalf of the men group it mr president ladies and gentlemen i should like to thank mrs ferreira for her excellent work
of course the level of taxation will not rise as europe is already too heavily taxed
let me stress that i believe that a solution can be found on the issue and in this respect i thank parliament for its understanding and cooperation
i believe i have because as far as the procedure is concerned we have two options

tuna stocks are collapsing
if we were to analyse the changes in employment figures in the various economic sectors we would soon see a rapid and significant reduction in the number of people carrying out their activities in the agricultural sector a different trend towards job losses in the industrial sector and in contrast a clear positive increase in the numbers of people working in the services sector

firstly economic and monetary union
– i do not think i said anything of the kind
both these bodies agree basically with the amendments by the committee on civil liberties justice and home affairs and approve the proposal as amended and unanimously approved by our committee with the exception of the point referred to by commissioner fretting in connection with the participation of the european parliament with observer status should it so wish on the colleges governing board
we addressed them in separate documents

as i too take the view that the possibility of confusion with protected geographical indications governed by regulation two hundred and eight thousand, one hundred and ninety two must be excluded i agree unreservedly with the new recital in proposed amendment no fifteen
mr president on a point of order you may be aware that parliaments entire email system has practically crashed
in the framework of fisheries partnership agreements the council conclusions referred to earlier require coherence between the objectives of the cup and the objectives of other community policies such as environmental objectives

that will be of interest in a very short time i hope to all the countries that have asked to join the european union the twelve states which are to become members of the union and which i hope will become members as soon as possible but it occurs to me to say this to mr andria mr andria we are correcting the balances of european countries but why can you not succeed in finding a system that allows pensioners to correct their own balances of payments

there is an essential element of truth in the statement that all politics is local and while individuals throughout the eu twenty seven are concerned with the big issues of globalisation eu enlargement emigration energy supply et they are most often concerned with how these issues affect their lives their families and their communities equally with european legislation citizens are concerned with how this impacts on their lives and their communities

– minister if the consequence of such varying tax rates is to be that more businesses move elsewhere is thought perhaps being given to the possibility of speeding these deliberations up too many jobs are being lost as a result of what is termed subsidy tourism and we are currently with regard to regional policy giving thought to how we can do away with this

we are not going to get into a debate here on public aid and its effects on competition but if there is any public aid worthy of being seen as compatible with the objectives of the treaty then that is the aid aimed at promoting employment

yet with the rapporteur we support the proposal to strengthen trading relations with uzbekistan
therefore chernobyls problems are our problems too
de mr president i have another supplementary question for the council with regard to the mr possess question
europe has much to gain from researchers from third countries
the ball is in their court
may i thank all the previous speakers for their contributions to what will surely be a common position on this matter
first the existing provisions are increasingly subject to legal challenge in the european court of justice something needs to be done about this
i have lost count of the number of people who have written to me not organizations trying to exploit the workers but ordinary workers asking why we are even having a discussion about this and saying that we should not stop them from choosing the hours they work
the second request is that an independent study be conducted and i await a serious offer from the commission on this not just we have an open mind the commission does not have an open mind
question no fifty nine by h thirteen thousand, two hundred and one
ladies and gentlemen do you know that gaz de france which has a monopoly prevents small license holders extending their trade in gas to serve the population by invoking monopoly
i cannot be more specific other than to say that the multiannual strategic programmer is helpful
but we will also cooperate closely with the governments concerned for they now have an opportunity through reconstruction to improve their economic and technical structures and also their social environmental and political structures we shall also call on the governments to make the appropriate contributions here
the commission has done its job and kept its promise
i think it is especially important to ask ourselves whether an election can genuinely be described as democratic if a large number of the television channels are compromised
the commission is proposing a reform of agricultural policy but the council and parliament are resisting this and proposing that the subsidies be made still more bureaucratic overgenerous and vulnerable to fraud and trickery
they must serve justice and the rule of law furthermore we have some fundamental demands
in nineteen eighteen france said that germany would pay
we must thank the rapporteur for her good offices in providing a compromise solution that everyone could accept even those of us who thought that her original report expressed the different aspects of the common fisheries policy more successfully
personally i could anticipate further measures in this sphere as for any others i could not speculate whether there will be any transfer of competence
mr president the minister s reply leads me to ask her whether she is aware that a few weeks ago a delegation from the european parliament visited cuba
madam president ladies and gentlemen i agree with you and with commissioner mccreevy that we now have a better directive in front of us one which i hope will find a very broad majority at first reading i say this not only as a result of having followed this debate but as a result of the work of the last few weeks and months
we assume that the next justice and home affairs council will be doing some of that
i hope that the history of armed conflict of cruelty beyond imagination in that part of europe will be over once and for all and i think the european union plays an essential part in that
does mrs pitcher share the view of the world bank far and un
communities whether national or european need points of reference that are not exclusive but that guarantee enduring relations
we are helping them by polishing internal borders
while this can be seen as a technical matter it is in fact highly political because the way we adapt our rules directly impacts on our ability to influence eu legislation
the ford report deals with the code of conduct for lobbyists in the european parliament
i would also like to congratulate you on clearly advocating that there should be just one executive and not two
the european union has started to realize that persecution on religious grounds is a serious violation of human dignity and freedom
it seeks to force syria to comply with un security council resolutions on lebanon yet fails to mention the fact that israel continues to occupy part of syrian territory attacks lebanon and continues to pursue its policy of state terrorism against palestine
of course we will all see and closely follow how things will unfold in the coming days and weeks
there is no such thing as bad europeans
we therefore believe the report to be a step backwards and we will vote against it again if the new amendment no five is not adopted since it is better than the amendment no two which appears in the current miguélez ramps report
it must be made clear that the european council is assuming its leadership role and that parliament is taking up its proper place the place to which it is entitled as the directly elected representative of the people of europe
it is as follows
mr president i do not wish to make any further comments but merely to draw attention to the following
parliaments draft resolution also identifies these issues in its twenty ten report on the results achieved the commission concluded that iceland meets the political criteria required for membership and even though it was hit hard by the economic and financial crisis it is suitably prepared to take the measures necessary to meet the requirements of eu membership
eu law also has its origins in international law
then suddenly one finds that one is going to have to deal with something that gives europe its historic and cultural depth namely its languages
i assume at least that she will take parliament seriously
the council is mainly to blame for failing to make adequate progress on its recommendations concerning education and training greater flexibility on the labour market new working hours shorter working hours and above all shifting taxes on labour onto other targets
the council must improve its way of working in order to work effectively on longer problems such as we can observe in iran bears russia and elsewhere as well as to respond rapidly to exceptional situations such as
perhaps i could ask colleagues to take particular note of the use of the word because the u k has repeatedly stated that formal agreements with targets are absolutely essential in any international climate change regime not least because they give incentive and certainty to the business community
article forty two introduces the possibility for member states to impose additional information requirements
medical tourism is a totally different issue
f r mr president unlike mr gollnisch i am of the opinion that we cannot allow civilians to die amid general indifference as they are exposed to force and violence employed by an illegitimate head of state
in my own country there are about twenty two zero people employed in the dairy sector
ladies and gentlemen despite certain positive economic and political signals the situation in chechnya continues to call for prudence and vigilance at this stage
come follow us
even the difficult social situation cannot justify the violation of the law
i have every confidence that it will
i think that has to be our target
i am not so lacking in selfconfidence that i feel any need to be bound solely by what others are suggesting
nevertheless we hope that we might be able to lay the foundations of such an agreement particularly after chancellor schroeders tour of the capitals which begins on fifteen march
if europe wishes to act intelligently on the international stage then it must also set an example in relation to the regulation and supervision of the financial markets
i am therefore particularly pleased to note that this concept is expressed clearly and forcibly by parliament in the report
it is vital for us in the european parliament to retain our influence at european level this does not mean that we also wish to discuss the technical details in the plenary or in committee
i do not need to explain how serious that is for the marine environment
firstly the teachers need to be trained adequately
turning now to the human rights clause i am pleased that parliaments report emphasises the potential for the clause to induce positive change in the human rights situation in third countries
we should therefore make every effort to encourage the iranian government and especially the president to continue along the path of liberalisation and democratization
can you please briefly repeat the question you have just put
we have responded by developing over the last ten years an effective eu asylum and migration policy
this is the reason why we are alarmed at the situation whereby polish czech and hungarian entrepreneurs are coming up against obstacles deliberately placed in their way by administrations hindering their economic activity on the territory of the old union
similarly problematic is the use of the expression that protect the safety of civil aviation this phrase applies mainly to the protection of civil aviation from terrorism which is important but forms only part of the package of measures on protection against unlawful acts
life must be a powerful guarantee of the maintenance and strengthening of what we have created so far also with regard to habitats and the variety of species we have
what i have in mind in particular are proposals dealing with the simplification of crosscompliance requirements including postponement until twenty thirteen of the implementation of requirements relating to the area of animal welfare area century by new member states regrettably many solutions have been designed in a way which does not take into account the situation or the model of agriculture existing in new member states
i do not believe we need to do anything to achieve our objectives in the engine industry at present because admixture is permissible and technically possible in small quantities
one of them is what we call the piano väyrynen pillar in other words the arctic
mr president i would like to stress what an atypical situation we are actually in because it would in fact be right for the council to follow this discussion from now on as it is a subject that requires a joint decision
these needs cannot be fully met unless they are applied at every level of planning decisionmaking implementation and monitoring of structural policy
the proposal is based on a toxicological evaluation and a technological analysis
in writing we of course sympathies with the plight of poor countries
without a clear and mutually accepted definition of terrorism states must be able to take whatever measures they deem appropriate to deal with these serious threats
i heard the commissions answers to mr touches and mrs pulling oral question just now
the age limit has been used as one method of controlling the number of applicants
the european parliament decided on its own position at the start of june
in order to meet the challenges the commission should conduct an open debate with various representatives of the judicial system including in particular legal professionals
mr president the weaknesses of this report do not lie in the fact that it condemns breaches of human rights where they exist but in my opinion in the way in which it has been drafted and in the methodology used to present these condemnations
arguments relating to transport safety and to minimizing the number of accidents are also in favour of the public transport option for these objectives to be achieved legislative flexibility is called for
it is clear that in this particular case we are dealing with a directive whose implementation has been very complicated in the majority of member states given that the finetuning of the mechanisms needed to meet the objectives of the directive is in itself a very complicated issue
let me add some information concerning the performance this year of the activities in the media programmer
as chairman of the european parliaments southern caucasus delegation i regard the eu ministerial troikas visit under the swedish presidency last february as the basis for necessary initiatives
similarly we must take into account that we in europe have managed to overcome the nationalism that did us so much harm in the past
regarding the middle east we must ensure that the presidential elections in palestine give the road map a new boost and that the israeli unilateral decisions such as the withdrawal from gaze are included in the negotiations with the quartet so that the creation of the palestinian state can be completed within the established time frame
dirty bombs will shatter into pieces the several centimeter thick armour plates of the most modern tanks
last month after the defendants surrendered to the authorities those sentences were confirmed in less than one minute without a presentation of evidence by the prosecution or defence or an examination of the witnesses
the timetable in which member states will produce their maps to d g i v predetermined potentially objective two areas on the future structural fund map
the conclusions of this study that we are carrying out will also be taken into account in the revision of the guidelines on the transeuropean networks and furthermore the interred i i programmer has also financed general studies on the suitability and viability of a future central crossing in the pyrenees adapted to heavy goods transport
i would therefore urge you to set aside more money for this programmer and to intensify the research into the causes and reduction of diseases
we intend to adopt a recommendation on such a common definition for all legislative sectors in the near future
however they have ignored the environmentalists suggestions that changing the route of the motorway would avoid damaging the environment and would save money
as regards the flexibility of the second pillar perhaps you will allow the presidency to take the intergovernmental conference in hand which it will do following the general affairs council next monday ten july
neither can we accept amendment no one hundred and two which removes the possibility of alternate board members or amendment no one hundred and forty three which insists that the management board shall meet only in public since this should left to the boards own discretion
we should have the nerve to draw the necessary conclusions to refer to the rules in the association agreement and dare to take measures
at item twenty seven of the report the european parliament calls attention to the need to further invest in education professional training and research
the source of aid funds must not be concealed instead the commission must ensure that it is clearly affirmed and that every locality to which it goes receives a report stating what proportion is derived from european funds
when you look at the differences in consumer credit rates around europe from six in some countries up to twelve in others it surely is time that the consumer got a better choice
i was far less clear that the quality of the decisions on economic policy were as sound
if we are to speak in terms of mobility in europe these days the training centre is not necessarily to be tied to the business or to where the driver lives
those who achieved so much in such a short time should be full of selfconfidence and pride
therefore honorable parliamentarians i ask you again as i did before to give your assent to activating the interim trade agreement with turkmenistan
i attach the greatest importance to the establishment of some sort of watchdog made up of representatives of employers employees and the commission to monitor how the situation develops this body would function as an early warning system designed to bring any problems arising to a speedy resolution
i welcome the fact that the councils conclusions already specifically mention female entrepreneurship
even the committee on budgetary control is stressing the serious abuses in the management of european union aid to bosniaherzegovina
my suggestions for the reform of the commission proposal are designed to address the considerable problems which continue to undermine the implementation of union water policy
is it not hypocrisy to proclaim interest in environmental protection while traditional crops are being extirpated and genetically modified crops are accepted even before serious and detailed research has been carried out and completed on their environmental impact and their consequences for the consumer solely because that is what the multinationals which produce genetically modified reproducing species dictate
in view of mr bolkesteins statement that amendment no thirteen will be accepted by the commission i believe this is a very important clarification and i would ask that it be accepted
lastly it is perfectly natural that the sanctions provided for in the regulation should be governed by the general principles of criminal law and statistics
soon however the introduction of the our on one january nineteen ninety nine will give the european union new life putting it in a different position in international economic monetary and political relations
the crocodile tears we have shed over the divisions between palestinians are really inappropriate after the european union was incapable of supporting mahmoud abbas efforts to coop the pragmatic wing of hams
i do not know why the commission needs to put money in to pay itself for the job it is doing
and i appeal to you all let us not let europe and certain countries in the european union increase their energy dependence on one source or another
however i would also strongly emphasis that with this package the ce scheme will be greatly improved through increased market surveillance and the obligation for member states to prosecute in the event of misuse of the ce marking
in writing p t the civil protection mechanism was set up five years ago to facilitate the mobilization and coordination of civil protection resources in the event of emergencies inside or outside the eu
france has traditionally had a longstanding connection with christians in the near and middle east
i gather from the press that the mood of the meeting was very good which is not surprising given that you are old friends so in that sense i hope we can look forward to a rosier future in transatlantic relations
on the one hand there are the military who tend to play the afghan card or count on iran for support
on the contrary the entrance of the european union into the military use of space is a serious escalation in the arms race which is extremely dangerous to world peace
the citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for eu provisions to be comprehensible to them this is what enables them to understand what is going on
as my colleague mr walls and the council presidency have said we know that terrorism is still one of the greatest threats to our values and to our democracies
this then is an overall programmer and when it is studied is important not to take individual points out of context
in the medium term interim campaigns such as the provision of fresh fruit in schools are essential
unemployment is here to stay for some time in most of our countries and that is a very very serious situation it calls for european and national solutions
when you speak impartially for this house when you are a credit to its standing and a defender of its prerogatives you can count on our backing
he contrasts the position in the united states and the european union in terms of jobs spinoffs and the development of a scientific culture
that fear seems grossly exaggerated
in any case it is scheduled that aid for orders will come to an end in december next year and i do not think we can reconcile ourselves to a laissezfaire policy
i believe it is important only to voice an opinion on whether the applicant country has fulfilled the criteria because otherwise we discriminate among member states on the basis of whether they joined the our zone earlier or will do so in future
we have always denounced for example from lampedusa this gross trade in human flesh
all of these models must have equal worth when it comes to implementation
but i should add this however much one invests in the infrastructure and we will be looking at specific pledges at the donors conference early in the new year however much one spends on infrastructure what is crucial is to encourage greater and freer trade between the countries of the region and even in one or two countries within the countries of the region
this is the only way in which we will whet the appetite of these people for our values and facilitate the transition process which the country will go through
they should be called to account
it madam president baroness ashton ladies and gentlemen the new strategic concept developed by to contains important positive changes to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century in a manner consistent with the values of the atlantic pact
many of them apply for asylum in european countries
mr president ladies and gentlemen for some considerable time european integration has been endeavoring to bring transnational forms of cooperation under company law
it ensures respect for human rights and for the dignity of the individual
the question therefore arises as to how on earth the left can be against this free trade agreement how can anyone be against lifting millions of indian people out of poverty and how can the left be against fighting for an open market for european enterprises
so if we are serious we must adopt this coordinated approach and i appeal to the commission and the council to work more closely together in terms of the final production of european and national policy in the context of agenda two thousand
the following stages will be examined to a certain extent in the first mister review in two thousand and three
our aim has always been to provide consumers with general information on infringements of copyright in line with the commissions original proposal
in fact the matter was discussed with my services twice in august
i want to remind you all that the legal basis of this directive is the health and safety of workers i must end by warmly thanking my many colleagues in the group of the european peoples party christian democrats and european democrats for all the support that they have given me in this process
accordingly i hope that this directive in its present form with the amendments made by our committee can be approved under the belgian presidency
the commission is confident that all member states will be ready to connect their national systems to the central part of the vis as explained until end two thousand and six
in terms of the markets we now have two situations at variance with one another a surplus of beef and veal and a deficit of sheepmeat
this is not what the citizens of the want it is not what the wants either
where can we achieve a substantial gain in terms of public health but at the same time not hamper the technological development of european food production
this compromise will in my view provide adequate protection for rights
although it likes to play with words the us administration has never denied the existence of the flights the kidnappings or the illegal prisons
the compromise text also takes account of the issue of bees and of their crucial role in the ecosystem
indeed not only are our legal bases for the new policies not ready but we are not ready either to champion and implement all the policies wished for by europeans
it madam president ladies and gentlemen of all europes policies the common agricultural policy is the one that has had to be updated the most over the years in order to cope with constant changes occurring on the economic front including at international level
adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the eu if concentrations of for example phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment european agriculture would not for example be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread
the arrogance with which the president of the commission has received parliaments criticism is incredible and unacceptable
we know annette and the new president of taiwan chen shuibian
at the same time we have to state right away that it can only fulfill its role if endowed with real competence and the tools for effective functioning
warsaw poland is part of the old europe and shares our roots and we should not allow anyone to divide europe into two halves no it is up to us to act in unison
it is therefore outrageous that countries such as italy and the united kingdom have blocked the necessary improvements in the council
for example it is questionable whether the restrictive measures represent a necessary and effective tool however we must not allow people who do not want to sign a petition calling for the abolition of these measures to be beaten and harassed
however we need to adhere to its criteria without losing sight of the objective of growth
however within the report paragraphs two and four pervert and distort the real aims of cohesion and everything else which has been promised
ladies and gentlemen next european council took place at an important moment
we agree with the request to establish simpler more targeted legislative measures in order to facilitate the implementation of the legislative arsenal applicable to the internal market which in our opinion lacks transparency and is too fragmented to until confidence in consumers
this ten is very small
it would be enough if action were taken there
on behalf of the use group p t i would like to begin by congratulations the rapporteur
i should also like to stress that uncontrolled reproduction represents another particular and potential source of most in food and feed
a brief word about pilot projects and preparatory actions you say in your report mr mulder that the margin of our eighty million is not very great
i should first of all mention that the commissions white paper a strategy for europe on nutrition overweight and obesityrelated health issues highlights the importance of taking practice steps to reverse the decline in physical activity and the actions suggested in the area of physical activity in this white paper and in the white paper on sport mutually reinforce and complement each other
to require workers to systematically work overtime and put in long working weeks is to destroy jobs
it is of fundamental importance that today as we begin the second reading we demonstrate the same attitude
however it is essential for turkey to undertake radical reforms itself not just in words but above all in deeds
this is the only way to ensure a common and coherent stance as regards illegal immigration
if we want to move to a system of fisheries management which works and i think that is what we all want to do then we must be prepared to embrace a radically different approach
we have to work within the constraints of the budget and the perspective as defined by the budgetary authority as a whole
unless i have missed a key point i do not believe there is an alternative to planned legal migration
the council sternly rejected this and rightly so
however in the absence of universal recognition of international legitimacy on what legal grounds can the courts indict those in contravention who simply lost the war
this is an important distinction and it still needs to be maintained at certain points in the text
i believe we will now very possibly be able to conclude the erika package and the agency will be implemented as soon as possible but as you know ladies and gentlemen it is not us who decide the headquarters but we hope that the next european council will come to an agreement and finally tell us where it will be and the sooner the better since it is very urgent
and i proposed that our parliament should have an annual meeting with representatives of civil society
my group will support you mr degree on the first two issues the initiatives of the council but unfortunately not on the recommendation
how will it become more active at local level
the fourth paragraph of amendment no nine is also very important as this can permit further horizontal coordination not only to include the european union but also other bodies such as the european investment bank which could implement a great many projects
maritime transport is the most environmentally friendly
this shows first the terrible ability of the north korean leadership to keep their country isolated from any external interference and in todays globalised world that is not easy and secondly the degree of capitulation and humiliation to which the population has been reduced the violations and violence not only affect their bodies through hunger and the concentration camps but also their minds for they have been brainwashed and left unable to think as in the soviet glass the north koreans have been reduced to sheep that follow their leader blindly
there has been a coup in the côte divine
the willingness of the largest groups to maintain the restrictions to the concerned public which will be defined by the member states is a surefire way to continue to leave certain people deeply dissatisfied and feeling sidelines at least we managed to support the rapporteurs proposals to have some definition as to what the concerned public might be
taiwan respects the terms agreed for international trade
it should also have monitored its adequacy
mr president not so long ago this parliament adopted a resolution which spoke about the new possibilities for developing transatlantic relations after the election of president drama in the united states
that is of course in a way what they have elected ourselves as mess to do
mr president two hundred and forty million people live in an archipelago that would stretch from london to baghdad indonesia is massive in geography and population
the assertion that turkey would import terrorism and gangsterism is libelous and an insult to our to ally
let us work to achieve a new consensus on the enlargement
the value of solidarity must also be fully endured in this area
we would ask the leaders not to change that attitude not to respond to terror with terror that we may act jointly above all in order to achieve something very important because now is the time to strengthen our alliance with the united states and with all the people of the world who share our ideal of peace justice and freedom
for the aforesaid reasons we have chosen to vote in favour of the report since we basically think it is extremely important to combat racism and xenophobia
it is my view that a practical solution must be found to this as soon as possible commissioner and that we need a much quicker approach and also if possible a formula that will enable us to adopt an envelopeoriented way of working
we owe it to his tenacity and his great powers of persuasion that we can justifiably say that the logic of a policy of mere renationalised charity confined to the poorest has not carried the day
the operational programmes are focusing on two areas
the group of the greenseuropean free alliance has tabled two different proposals on reach one is that which the greens are actually promoting the other is the amendment that we had kept up our sleeve which contains the improvements now adopted by the council but not the things that actually made it worse that were done on the last night of the negotiations at the request of the conservatives and against the wishes of the committee on the environment public health and food safety
industry is becoming ever more concentrated and what counts here is the creation of european structures linking the european union the sea and the member states which will facilitate more effective cooperation across the board
indeed in the us it is my understanding that many g m crops have been shown not to increase yield but even to possibly decrease yield
mr president ladies and gentlemen i will start by congratulations the rapporteur on his strong points for example the replacement of american and british troops by un security troops which will in time improve the security situation to a vast degree
this must go hand in hand with a strengthening of the roles of europol and eurojust
have they already been submitted to the commission
i understand perfectly well that they must recover their investment and they have the right to profits but they cannot be owners of the hydrocarbons and nor can they control them
you would then not have announced the withdrawal of the proposal for the council resolution approving the european accession to the joint convention on the safety of spent fuel management and on the safety of radioactive waste management without having already noticed that it had already been adopted
however they should also take into consideration that perhaps in one way or another the opinions given by this house as well as those of the european commission and of course the council when determining the groups of countries and the processes through which they were to negotiate their accession have aroused a great deal of interest in slovak society and public opinion which has finally opted for the path of democracy and respect for the rule of law
agreements are for the honorable the janjaweed are not honorable
it may not be within your power presidentinoffice to fully answer mr paisleys question but i support what you said about the importance of the irish language
moreover apart from the constitutional treatys specific elements we need it because the long term stability prosperity and coherence of europe are of fundamental importance for our people as well as for people beyond our borders
on the one hand it is about the efficient use of the surveillance which technology and geography make possible
let me say first of all that we will be looking into establishing experimental fisheries under article five of the protocol
but i hope we will be able to maintain a frequent dialogue on human rights issues
meanwhile a tax on c o two emissions would make the polluter pays principle fairer and more consistent contributing not only to reducing climate change but also to financing investment projects in this area
having made this point i turn to the more positive and more complex position of the commission on the other proposed amendments tabled by mr miller in the report
mr president as you will remember this was discussed at the conference of presidents last thursday and there was agreement that some of that explanatory statement was not in line with the rules of this house
i must say that the starting point of the commissions initiative but mainly too of the amendments to the commissions proposals tabled by the european parliament were the problems created in the management of community funds specifically in the area of tourism and the fact that the survey carried out revealed that there are many loopholes in the orders of the financial regulation vagueness of those orders and unclear distinctions between what a body may or may not do
for that reason it is high time we finally managed to factor the external cost of hev operations into the european toll disc
as we know the in is not going to consider the problem
it includes the obligation to set up an underwrite financial guarantee for each installation before the beginning of the operation the directive includes strict maximum limit values of cyanide concentration before this substance is stored in ponds for remaining residues to be broken down by oxidation sunlight or bacteria
finally our fellow members from the baltic wanted the baltic to be a sort of pilot project enabling us to move more quickly in view of the urgency of the situation
i walked about the streets alone with no problems whatsoever at no time did i feel threatened
it is difficult to see what reasons there might be for the councils position except perhaps mean financial reasons
there is no end of condemnation going on
this delay has in actual fact put a damper on a very great many proposals and ideas for cooperation when it comes to the european social economy
that i must admit is somewhat perplexing and i wonder today what purpose is served by an extension until nineteen ninety seven only
it is optimistic and it shows us the way in which we can make sure our work in research meets the requirements of sustainable development he highlights many actions
this is a resolution on the proposed decision of parliament and the council on the mobilization of the european globalisation adjustment fund in terms of point twenty eight of the interinstitutional agreement of seventeen may two thousand and six between parliament the council and the commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management
we have also grown accustomed to referring to state terrorism individual terrorism global terrorism local terrorism and fundamentalism
for history teaches us that the netherlands golden years as the wealthiest nation in the seventeen century world came from uniting the seven provinces not dividing them
that is why the group of the greens in tandem with the socialist group is tabling four extra amendments
that is not surprising they will sometimes exaggerate and sometimes the commission may underestimate
i should also like to stress the need for greater coordination between european regional policy and other community policies and between the structural funds and other funding mechanisms
to redress stress in the banking sector a comprehensive range of measures including deleveraging and structuring will need to be taken to contribute to ensuring that the irish banking system performs its role properly in the functioning of the overall economy
this cultural diversity and wealth will allow us to gain a better understanding of ourselves
on accounting standards themselves it is vitally important to keep the underlying approach as agreed within the international accounting standards board is the integrity of these rules will be tested by attempts to dilute them for national reasons
the discussions in the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy pursuant to rule fifty nine did not bring any new findings to light consequently the committee is submitting today the report that has been on the table since twenty four january nineteen ninety six when it was adopted by forty seven votes to one
we posted a donors conference for reconstruction and economic support in georgia and we included georgia together with arena and azerbaijan in the european neighbourhood policy
mr president i would like to draw attention to a fundamental conflict which is already becoming apparent in relation to the european social fund est
it is therefore time for europe to invest more in these areas to compete on the world stage the european union must develop innovative products and modern services
that violence must stop now and i should like personally and on behalf of my country to thank for the clear signal he has sent out today in parliament and for the solidarity he has shown with my country and with all those countries that have been attacked
but our resources are already stretched to the limits
in a changing world we must be in a position to make adjustments to the budget far more quickly so that without increasing the overall budget we might meet any new needs including first and foremost the development needs of the new member states in eastern europe but also the need for emergency aid and reconstruction in the balkans which ought not to be financed through cutbacks in support to the third world
it must include the strengthening of the common agricultural policy an appropriate fiscal policy and maintenance of its budget in consideration of the many beneficial effects of agriculture on the environment health and climate change
this tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy
the right regulatory environment including cutting red tape is of paramount importance to small firms and to job creation
there is a legal basis in the lisbon treaty for some specific actions that can be taken
the delegation believes that support for highest milk should be abolished completely whilst healthy milk should receive the greatest support
conditions and climatic factors vary a good deal between the member states and regions
that is why i think it is important that this interparliamentary delegation exists
the elder group feels that the european parliament must adopt a clear position here
i should also like to stress my concern regarding the risks of strictly us customs controls turning into hidden trade barriers
it is good to know that this is in line with the choices that are now being made in the united states
mrs boogerdquaak if i have understood correctly you are asking for this vote to be postponed pursuant to rule one hundred and thirty one
what we should be using these resources for though is the raising of awareness through seminars and the award of research contracts through clarifying the degree to which experience and information are being exchanged and how matters stand in the other countries as well as planning projects on the protection of the regions
today you have just completed your second week of plenary session in this building and you have accepted my proposal for this discussion in a very constructive spirit
p l mr president todays discussion is one of the most important and significant discussions to be held in the european parliament
we have a lead in europe but we are not encouraging that
this is what the european council in luxembourg committed itself to in november
in other respects i believe this debate to have been basically necessary
if appliances are made compulsory but if the legal speed limit is not sufficiently restricted then this looks more like a disguised form of subsidy for companies that can tap into a new market in this way
instead an attempt should be made to carry out an overall assessment of the accumulated effects of the many consents which are issued upon the fertility of the soil the food chain biological diversity and the health issues which are of importance to us as human beings
yet the commission tells us that sees as i said must be targeted and actively encouraged to get involved
author mr president the two amendments relate firstly to article nine
so we must concentrate our efforts on basic research if we wish to lead the field in the technology of the future
i am not saying that the intergovernmental conference should just have blindly approved the draft as moreover the heads of state and government were wise to do in the case of the draft charter of fundamental rights i am saying that the intergovernmental conference should purely have checked for shortcomings and contradictions in the draft as it should be doing now and discussed how to overcome them
some people perhaps even some in this house say that there is conflict between noise emissions and the safety properties of tyres

finally let me offer a reflection on the multilateral process
the draft legislative resolution on the council position at first reading with a view to adopting a directive of the european parliament and of the council on the application of patients rights in crossborder healthcare is an important document and adopting this resolution would mark a significant step forward from a social perspective the possibility for eu citizens to be treated anywhere in the eu will force states whose healthcare systems are in a precarious state to change their priorities and devote the proper attention to this area

rapporteur it mr president ladies and gentlemen with the mandate for the trialogue the budget procedure entered its most concrete phase the phase in which the budgetary authorities actually enter into discussions which may produce useful and significant results

the proposal on external actions moreover seems disappointing
finally on the issue of nutrient profiles let me state that i cannot accept the amendments to delete or modify article four in the proposed way as this provision would undermine the existing regulation on food claims

the second is a general point mr president as i think we shall be seeing a difficult budgetary discussion in coming years
the house has already addressed this in detail earlier this evening in a different context
it is also right that the group should be strengthened
on the contrary the mechanism for the monitoring of the adoption of management and control systems and of major projects shows that they are getting off to a slow start
with regard to vat and excise duties for example administrative procedures have been put in place which respect the fiscal independence of member states whilst preserving the principle of the single market
what matters now is to achieve a common policy at the level of the european union in the field of education above all as well as in sport culture and politics to combat extremism

this is of course just the tip of the iceberg because we should also address human trafficked networks that provide support to illegal immigrants and also of course member state governments that legalized illegal aliens on a massive scale after all it is precisely this impunity that is one of the major draws in this whole issue of illegal immigration

accordingly we are bound to express our opposition to those who perpetrate such evils

fortunately however there were those who did believe and people with the fire of josé sócrates prime minister of portugal will go down in history for their determination precisely because they did believe they believed and made it happen which is why we have the treaty of lisbon

lastly it is crucial that we take a closer interest in the space telecommunications sector in order to increase demand and to maintain skills in our industry

in my opinion it is not enough to have national policies to combat unemployment from now on
that is why i welcome this plan which includes several positive guidelines a crucial reduction in costs and constraints for the fishermen a revision and harmonization of the control and monitoring provisions under the auspices of the community fisheries control agency which is something that mediterranean fishermen who all too often feel have been specifically waiting for and closer involvement for those working in the sector in the definition of the guidelines management of fishing efforts control measures and catch limits which echoes a strong demand that i am voicing at the european parliament on behalf of mediterranean fishermen

i would appreciate it as well if the commissioner whom i welcome to his new post could perhaps bring a fresh pair of eyes as opposed to a pair of tags to this issue even though it is not within his remit and accept that this wellmeaning but deeply flawed proposal is precisely what the sheep and goat sector of europe does not need at this time or at all

no less so in the middle east because there you have a situation where there are many joint ventures between israel and palestinians where produce in some cases is partly manufactured in the palestinian area and in the state of israel and these developments are good things they augur well for the future because if trade is being done in this way in the middle east then that will be the bedrock of any peace agreement

a programmer of this kind may form the basis for further measures
we must also embed the lisbon strategy

forty years ago the objective of the customs union was to abolish duties at internal borders between member states and to make the idea of a common market a reality
in essence this is a totalitarian programmer it is opposed to pacifist ideals and provokes threats of war

your answer to the israel syria question should go somewhat beyond to the tigris and to the euphrates to turkey and to syria and elsewhere

however faced with worsening social and economic conditions the response or lack of response from the eu reflects its class choices insisting on continuing with policies which promote the accumulation of huge profits by the large economic and financial groups to the detriment of the living conditions of workers and the general population
it is difficult to see the two facts in complete isolation from one another
that is why this is an internal market problem that is why we need article one hundred a as the legislative basis
i listened to the then commissionerdesignate for enlargement during his hearing in the foreign affairs committee in which he appeared to demonstrate for example a very high degree of readiness to sweep all complaints against the accession of noneuropean turkey under the carpet as has happened for five years now
the distance between the citizens and the european elite is growing in such a way that the entire european project is put at risk whereas instead everyone should be working towards true democracy

i would like to give the example of portugal which has launched an ambitious programmer of construction of childcare facilities

once the council has reached a common position and it comes back to parliament it is no longer the property of the commission
mr president ladies and gentlemen resistance to antimicrobial agents now causes hundreds of thousands of deaths the world over

i do not think this is the right way commissioner to relaunch and develop the internal and international market sector international demand for rosé wine is not falling but rising and in this case the right approach is not to produce more using winemaking practices that owe more to a chemistry set than anything else but to invest in quality in specialization and in the characterization of european wines in the marketing and promotion of real wine in general in order to extend the market and finally make it easier for young people to enter the winemaking business

defending our values both european and universal means that silence is out of the question i thus fully support the condemnations of the brutal repression visited by the chinese security forces on tibetan demonstrators as well as all acts of violence from whichever source that have taken place in recent days
however a word of warning must be added the port i referred to has recently attempted to relocate to a location outside the city to deeper water
it is a question of maintaining equilibrium between copyright and the rights of consumers
so the gangs are spending huge sums on corrupting politicians judges and police officers
rights of ownership to land and water differ dramatically from one country to another
i said the other day mr president that i believed that so far the debates in the intergovernmental conference have produced a degree of frustration and i explained this like by saying that the debates we were seeing were a repetition of those we had held during the convention
next time the agenda will say continuation of morning votes after the votes on the topical and urgent debate
this must be done by mr milosevic
there are around twenty three million of them in the eu accounting for ninety nine of all businesses and providing over one hundred million jobs
like you we deplore the ethnic tension which is affecting everyone including the government

i do think it is a shame they have not even been here to participate in such an excellent debate
this dynamism is not evident from the level of development aid
when we started with the lisbon treaty the rules were the same every country had to ratify it or it fell
the commission has succeeded in spending the additional funding that we granted and in doing so usefully
thus without jeopardizing mr castigliones compromise i wish to table a new amendment to secure direct aid for diversification aid which the member states could include in their national allocations to help farmers in the transition to the new com the duration of this and the methods employed would be drawn up by the management committee
mr president i see that my previous explanations of vote have been heeded in the drawing up of this provision

mr president i have said nothing about a challenge and nor am i talking about packages i am talking about a serious accusation by which damages the prestige of this house
it calls upon the council of ministers to give a fresh impetus to the inclusion and enhancement of the european dimension in school curricula
the first concerns the incident at dover which shocked us all

we have always called for the release of all prisoners and we also call for a clear transition to democracy
madam president on behalf of my group i want to thank mr mulder for his report and say that my group accepts it and appreciates his hard work sincerity and fairness
we must not just condemn the coup but we must also make an explicit appeal for the release of the prisoners and hostages and demand the restoration of order and the rule of law which had made it possible for elections to take place in a normal and acceptable fashion within a democratic context
for that reason it is incomprehensible to me that manufacturers should design cars to travel at speeds in excess of one hundred and twenty five miles per hour
my argument is that we should not put down the single market because it is probably the best thing that we in the european union have ever done
learning the appropriate lessons from this and building a genuinely open and democratic europe remains one of our challenges for the future the programmer is also intended to make a contribution to this
they must know where the food came from
i would like to thank the commissioner and everyone else for the discussion we have been having here

we insist once again and i think that this is important that the ships crew be treated fairly in case of an accident and not erroneously regarded as criminals

b five hundred and five million, five hundred and twelve thousand and three by margrietus j van den berg on behalf of the use group on the end of the moratorium on the death penalty in the philippines
these requirements are perhaps too restrictive and they could end up cutting off the european market and could thus lead to protectionism through the back door which would be a bad thing
mr president it is a great honour and a pleasure for us to welcome you in a spirit of friendship to the european parliament as president of a new federal republic of germany you were able in an exemplary way to take up the challenge of national reunification before crossing the threshold of the new millennium
we have to be very careful
it is expressly the council and the commission itself which have this option not parliament although we could consider including it in a future treaty amendment
i voted for the report on the impact of the treaty of lisbon on the development of the institutional balance of the european union
the global economic crisis cannot be used as an excuse to do nothing or to deny climate justice climate change is a problem that needs to be tackled on a global basis and to do this it is necessary to build trust between us
i will begin by thanking the presidentinoffice for her answer
i know what that means
the member states economies are interwoven in a particular manner
we have adopted the biomass action plan that i have already mentioned and recently we adopted the communication on biofuels that shows that the commission is very serious about achieving better penetration of renewable energies in a european energy mix
here for example we have eliminated the subterfuge of referral but there is still the whole issue of public order the public order clauses which take up the crucial provisions of national law contained in the draft agreement
a second element in the do development agenda is the manufacture and import of unpatented medicinal products for developing countries that are undergoing a serious health crisis
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers but i would like to emphasis a few things
all must learn to give a bit if they are to take
any research policy based on this sort of perception and which serves this sort of policy is bound to distort the nature of research as a procedure for producing new knowledge and as a productive power
there has been a consistent effort to increase the numbers of women there is evidence of that
in order for the eu twenty twenty strategy to work we need a strong coordinated approach
democracy is vital of course
yet this year we had to produce parliaments owninitiative report on the eejnet a european alternative dispute network set up by the commission using a regulatory approach yet what could be more fundamental than our citizens access to justice or the way that law is applied and dispensed
we need trade between europe and the us to be made easier we need improvements in the area of joint standardisation
such a regulation is a harsh blow to employment and growth as it encourages capital to be kept in banks or to be converted into bonds or other financial products rather than into investments in production this is not taxation
in conclusion madam president ladies and gentlemen the commission cannot support the amendments which contradict the legal and administrative simplification sought by the slim initiative or which are contrary to the letter and spirit of current directives it notes the messages contained in other amendments and will present the result of its deliberations as and when appropriate
i would like to remind the house however that this involves one of the seven vertical directives relating to food products and that the question of coffee and chicory extracts has been dealt with on a par with that of chocolate which has proved more controversial for other reasons
fortunately member states and in particular france have used the powers of initiative which they still posses until one may two thousand and four to put forward other proposals which are more precise better targeted and therefore more effective there is a proposed framework decision aimed at reinforcing the penal code to stop the facilitation of unauthorized entry into and residence in the union a draft directive which seeks to improve the definition of facilitation of unauthorized entry movement and residence and a draft directive on hauliers liability if they carry illegal immigrants
there is just something that i am concerned about and that is that our citizens are simply not being told what this liquidity aid is actually being used for and the lack of transparency as regards the way that the irish are being forced in many peoples eyes under this umbrella

it has the unanimous support of all the affected regions and local authorities and will bring further positive effects in terms of economic development of areas far removed from the borders of the baltic sea macroregion

eu fish farms undertake rigorous inspection and quality control regimes to ensure that only the highest possible environmental and welfare standards are met and that the public is provided with an entirely safe nontoxic and reliable product
their interests have to be taken fairly and fully into account
i see the implementation of the rotterdam convention on prior informed consent pic as a positive step in this policy area
this debate also raised the issue of the almost philosophical question as to whether we have done all we can to improve the human rights situation
madam president the report we are now discussing is crucial for parents and children in europe as well as for europe as a community
despite this however we are moving the money and our priority is clear what matters is enlargement and the future of the eu
mr president could i first of all say on behalf of my committee how much i welcome the remarks by the presidentinoffice which raise the prospect that we might be able to reach agreement on the budget very quickly

draftsman of the opinion of the committee on the environment public health and food safety de mr president ladies and gentlemen parliament does not really have anything to say on this matter it has been consulted and it is being used for the preparation of a directive which will serve to maintain uncertainty rather than help to increase safety in the nuclear sector
businesses are restructured for various reasons sometimes for the purpose of defending them and sometimes in order to make them more combative but the process always has the same effects on employees namely that they become the adjustment variable where the strategies of industrial groups are concerned

mrs lunaceks motion for a resolution clearly shows the limited progress made by the country and i believe that the problems highlights make its joining the eu even less plausible as this would accentuate the heterogeneous character of the union to which the latest accessions are contributing
the most recent provocation was the closure of the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees on the eve of the seventh round of negotiations

according to the report by mrs mater we need to support the reintegration into the labour market of workers in slovenly who have been made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis i think this is a positive thing to do and have therefore voted in favour of it

a lot has been said here about development
we need to be aware that humanitarian aid is not a crisis management tool it should avoid having any effect on local politics or markets and remain independent of political circumstances
we hope that not only the commission present here but also the council will do as much
not least because the czech president does not share the mainstream eu view of the russiageorgia conflict
indeed we would have a few reservations about the benchmarking of framework conditions if the consequence of it was that matters which are essentially matters for subsidiary were analysed at community level that is the competence of member states such as the organization of public bodies in their relations with industry as is the case with energy policy for example
we thus voted in favour of proposals whereby pilotage services and selfhandling are to be excluded from the scope of the directive

discrimination against women is both the cause and the consequence of the hardships they suffer in times of war
both have argued that eighty two is a package and cannot be touched i therefore commend that particular approach to the house
but practical experience has shown me that at the end of the day it will probably not be possible to do a great deal more than simply circumscribe everything
firstly we were basically far too late in realizing the direction in which europe was sailing
the german power market is already completely dominated by four companies
not everything has been acquired yet but we are on the road to consultation

in this regard the achievement of optimum coordination between the commission and the european defence agency should be endured

however i believe that if there was a reappraisal of the general requirements relating to fair competition and civilized working conditions it is conceivable that some of the issues said to lie at the root of this dispute could over time be eased to the benefit of all

i would have to start by saying that there are some of us who in dealing with this matter in the legal affairs committee have perhaps begun to regret the passing of what in the previous legislative term was our joint committee for legal affairs and the internal market

while the commission is ready to show flexibility on this and to accept these amendments it should also be clear that this might have an impact on the overall timing of the selection process
we believe that the decision skates all too easily over the problems created by schengen for quite a few candidate countries for example when it comes to regional cohesion in the form of trade and other contact with neighboring states outside the eu the issue of kaliningrad s future to which the rapporteur does not give serious treatment also comes under this heading
however the council took only part of these elements into consideration at first reading

the situation being what it is these should now be set aside we will make no progress by looking for culprits and our concern must now rather be the development of a common strategy that will help us to resolve todays problem in a sensible way
europe commissioner added its problems thus overburdening the agenda with subjects unrelated to the specific field of international trade and providing an excuse for those who stood to benefit from applying pressure to slow down the process of integrating world markets but certainly these benefits i repeat did not extend to european consumers or indian or pakistani workers

it was disappointing commissioner to hear your statement and it was very disappointing mr presidentinoffice of the council to hear more empty words
in particular we have reached a provisional agreement on the title on political dialogue which contains important references to respect for human rights the fight against weapons of mass destruction the fight against terrorism et lubra has agreed to establish a regular dialogue on human rights and fundamental freedoms which was a key objective for us

i think that the upcoming twentieth anniversary of erasmus the most popular programmer in the european union is a great opportunity to evaluate the situation but also a challenge for us to do more together for education young people and the future

when we mention applying the principle of equality of treatment as one of the main objectives of the european unions social policy if such a policy existed we ought to remember that article one hundred and seventeen of the treaty of rome asserts the principle of equalization in progress which for example would prevent the retirement age for women coming up closer to that for men when it would be more favorable to bring the retirement age for men down to that of women on the basis of arguments of egalitarianism since in that way we will not achieve social equality and make any progress

i am convinced and i am not too far off the truth that some of the local action groups always financed and provided by the leader programmer will be refinance by the new objective two but i rather fear that many of them will be destined to disappear together with much of the aid support and incentives to rural development

mr cohnbendit thank you for your remarks
if the european court of human rights clearly has no respect for such human rights i cannot see that it is possible to recognize it here as an approved and appropriate decisionmaking body

however with my fellow commissioners i share the wish expressed in your discharge resolution we want to see soon a measurable acceleration of the progress made over the last years in improving the financial management of the european budget including the reinforcement of the main stakeholders responsibility and accountability
in my view these two matters are interlinked and are a result of the way the financial instruments that form part of the growth and employment initiative are constructed these are designed so as to commit budgetary resources to financial institutions such as venture capital funds national guarantee schemes and commercial banks which would act as intermediaries for final she beneficiaries
we therefore have a common ambitious programmer for the next six months and it seems to me that the various lines of action can all be traced back to a strong desire for a better quality of life
as she said it states that the effect would be insignificant and likely to remain so for thirty years
ladies and gentlemen we must find a balance an ancient balance which comes from greek mythology between the need for progress and the need to respect natural harmonies because life is beautiful and we should not play with it
on a personal note can i just add that i have recently had a medical examination by the european parliament
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen on behalf of the committee on budgets i would like to say that the lisbon objectives must remain the priority of the economic and social policies especially on the eve of enlargement and that it is therefore essential that the member states make available to the european budget the resources necessary for achieving those objectives
this is why the piece group in the committee on womens rights and equal opportunities has not accepted the text despite however much it is opposed to the oppression of women
indeed it suggests that they think they can now play a dominant role
on that occasion we allowed ourselves to be led by the media and the statements made by the united states applauding the attacks on the christian serbs who were threatening the brave muslims of kosovo
i also welcome the work done by the parties involved on achieving this objective
we are therefore trying to achieve too much with the european arrest warrant which is dangerous
an important even historic agreement has been concluded between who units and five pharmaceutical companies
i have had the opportunity of watching the conference of presidents in action it is consistently overworked and often illbriefed
since both institutions share the same objective strengthening the protection of fundamental rights it is essential to ensure that they collaborate closely
to conclude i should like to highlight the quality and importance of the work carried out by the rapporteur in the hope of helping european institutions to cope with the challenges they have yet to meet and overcome

it is not a question of covering the european area with a patchwork of statutes it is not a question of enclosing mountain regions behind shields or privileges
we have not yet reached that point
finally to indicate the complexity of the matter and the panoply of instruments through which the commission which is particularly active in this area is addressing the problem i should mention that we have proposed two draft directives on the issuance of electronic money
i say this particularly for our benefit ladies and gentlemen and would ask every one of us present here today to ensure in the groups that we do not ruin our reputation
i should also like very much to thank the members of the committee on agriculture and rural development and the other committees which have actively participated in the consultations for their constructive cooperation
there is cause for that now
we must work with civil society as we do with the developing countries and allow a frank exchange of views
so this directive is giving a necessary boost for the construction of energy services because the market by itself has not provided this development
that is why i am so grateful to you for mentioning this matter in your speech
the commission ought to say how it sees the possible enlargement of to and the western european union affecting the stability of the baltic sea area in this new initiative which the commission has proposed all the various points of view from environmental policy to security issues and economic development should be brought together

there are some issues on which political differences should be set aside not to make it appear as though a consensus could be reached but because they face everyone right across the board
it is in fact a question of moving the focus away from individual projects and towards those involved in order to allow an adequate development of the human resources and the organizational capacity in developing countries
the priorities which we have set ourselves here are of course democratic reforms including the framing and adoption of constitutional law improvement of the internal security situation i am thinking here of the widespread possession of arms amongst the population the necessary reorganization of the police institutional reforms and improvement of the administrative machinery and of course economic rehabilitation
in any event i welcome the fact that a wideranging structuring of d g vi is under discussion naturally we hope to receive more detailed information in this respect
i would firstly like to say that i completely agree with commissioner vitorino when he says that the european union should first teach by example and then preach

my amendments had a single purpose and i thank mr fatuzzo for recalling it and pointing it out which is to prevent the improper use of the institution of asylum and that of the political refugee we are running the risk of encouraging illegal immigration which as another member of this parliament has highlights in the debates of these few days also breeds terrorism
how far does it extend and in what does it consist
that is why i would be interested to know mr president of the commission whether your proposal today provides for different review procedures in the constitutional treaty
furthermore its administrative staff will be relatively small less than a hundred people so there will be no need for large premises
in the netherlands we have done without a one cent coin for years and everyone is quite happy about it
we would like to congratulate him warmly on his work
we must institutionalize the dialogue between researchers and policy makers and we must also convince our researchers that they have a duty to be politically active and a duty too to inform the citizen to explain what the issues are
in this case it is not for me to give an immediate response which would be complicated
europes new strategy must be based on a redefinition of the resources available for the mediterranean provide for an increase in financial commitments to facilitate political economic and social reform in the countries of the region and press for resources relating to immigration
therefore we swedish christian democrats believe that paragraph forty two of today s report which addresses issues such as the european parliament s assent to the accession treaties could be worded so as to be much more positive and welcoming
i do not think that anyone gives us the right to teach democracy to any of europes peoples
the crucial question to turkey is always what has actually changed
however the european union did manage to have the phrase scrapped which would have restricted the dialogue about basic labour standards to the ill and that enables us to continue our quest for a permanent forum
united nations statistics published in the renowned british medical journal indicate that the incidence of cancer in southern iraq increased sevenfold between nineteen eighty nine and nineteen ninety four
i greatly appreciate your personal ethic which has enabled you to recognize at least i think so that it is possible to be simultaneously a communist a democrat a european and a humanist
the european parliament was instrumental in ensuring that the necessary funding was provided for programmes such as erasmus to promote the young generation
this way these countries will be able to quickly take over the acquire communautaire the external evaluation of the first three years commissioned by the european commission shows that the foundation concentrated too much on managing programmes and too little on policy advice
nor is it true commissioner that we are not talking about health and safety on the road that is exactly what we are talking about commissioner
we learned a great deal together and from each other
mr president ladies and gentlemen this report is being presented on an evening when we have just discussed the excellent report by my colleague mr gyros and my own report is naturally complementary to his
the people of zimbabwe have a deepseated longing for democracy
however it should be emphasized that all the major economic and political powers in the world met to debate and assume responsibility for combating climate change
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i am actually against waste incineration because i believe that it does not solve the problem it merely shifts it elsewhere and in the end the volume of waste may be reduced a little but does not disappear
the right of a people to determine their own future is nonnegotiable and we should all respect that
for us this clarification is important
although i advocate research generally i cannot give my approval in this case visions of the future of renewable energy sources do not depend on financial input as their status in the whole field of energy will never be anything more than marginal
to regain the confidence of our peoples we must do more than just badge and rename the lisbon text and try to push ahead the new treaty was too easy to ridicule and too complex and obscure to explain making it difficult for yes campaigners in any country in a referendum
it is to be welcomed that the common position on the learning programmer outlined the same priorities as were approved by the european parliament at first reading
i will skip over mrs peas observations on the decentralization of decisions in terms of competition but not because i do not want to discuss them
of equal value to them it said were the basic rights of citizens in this specific case the freedom to express opinions and to demonstrate and as can be read in the charter of fundamental rights which we hope is shortly to be given added weight as part i i of the european constitution so was the requirement that the environment be protected in general and in what are termed vulnerable regions in particular
if any changes need to be made to the principle of legal privilege it should be done in this framework

the repression exercised by chişinău has now become a means for the authorities to communicate with the population
i am thinking in particular of a paneuropean infrastructure plan
as long as chorus is an independent state that is a matter for the republic of chorus but when chorus joins the european union part of our union will be occupied by turkish troops and i consider that to be unacceptable
i welcome the commitment of eu leaders to continue with a multilateral approach to trading issues
we maintain and we shall work to ensure that human rights are central both to the internal policy and the foreign policy of the union
in europe we play a fairly leading role in this but we need to ensure that we also retain this leading role
it is therefore quite obvious that these funds must be programmed as well as possible and put to the most effective use possible this is the aim behind the amendments that have been tabled to the next financial perspective
owing to certain disagreeable developments in one specific area and here i need name only the key words be health and the behaviour of the british government and i say british government deliberately because i do not mean the british people or great britain itself a situation has arisen in which all further progress is being blocked on certain fundamental issues and also at the same time on what one might call everyday decisions and there must be about eighty of these already
this has been our recommendation all along while not forgetting the numerous justified criticisms and recommendations
this newly elected chamber of citizens in the european union can fulfill the promise we have made to achieve a better eu with more democratic control and more transparency
denmark is also a country in which people have a very special way of looking at aid to developing countries
that is to say eu regulations should be managed and implemented on an allisland basis
i believe it is proper that we in parliament should not seek to make the best the enemy of the good in terms of possible solutions
the smaller states in particular are rightly on their guard against any tendency to blanket liberalization which would expose small enterprises to competition from large and financially powerful ones
mr president let me begin by warmly congratulations the rapporteurs on their excellent reports though i must admit that i am more personally familiar with the roubatis and narrow mourn reports and therefore find it easier to evaluate them
madam president ladies and gentlemen it is surprising how justice goes out of the door when it is left to the country of origin of to troops which is responsible for accidents or breaches of the law to assign responsibility and exercise a remote in both a physical and a moral sense form of justice from thousands of miles away
in conflict prevention and crisis management time is of the essence
this requires quality care and services adapted to every situation which necessitates public research for new medicines and treatments changes in mentality and different priorities for our society and in particular public budgets which meet our needs
mr president of the commission thank you for your contribution
for example with regard to access to the labour market
for that reason i hope that we in europe will achieve a situation where we could gradually reduce the use of coal as a source of energy and switch to renewable energy sources
possibly
i mention that to give you the full picture
we therefore need to find another way forward another policy and i believe that the if it is possible to discuss one element or another and the commission itself is prepared to consider certain amendments here or there that in this way an agreement will be possible within the council of ministers
therefore please accept parliaments outstretched hand
again i think it is regrettable that no one from the council is present at this important debate
i would like to make a few specific points that were highlights by the womens rights and equal opportunities committee
we are now making every possible effort to enable humanitarian organizations that specialist in medical care to provide access to such care for libyans and thirdcountry nationals in lubra
in addition we must remember that the defence industry acts as a catalyst for growth and innovation in other industries ranging from the hightech such as aerospace and information technology to the more traditional industries such as steel and shipbuilding
higher qualifications improve employability especially in the knowledge society which we keep on talking about
madam president ladies and gentlemen this is an important time for sport in europe because it is now firmly on the agenda this has come about quite simply because sport is a popular phenomenon
therefore we need integrated community assistance and policies that create opportunities we need solidarity in combating poverty
if we act on our own behalf let us then show that we mean business
i have been asked to welcome a visiting delegation in the gallery from the region of piedmont
the effects of including these three gases are modest as even the whole of the eu together would only add another two in c o two equivalent
i would now like to deal with the next issue facing us which is the vienna summit
as to the amendment requesting that the commission review and assess the i can only say that the commission has assessed them in its report
we also expect the kosovan leaders to show a constructive attitude including meeting serbian leaders who have stretched out a hand to them
nor did the commission fall over backwards to act
amnesty international estimates that around ten zero sentences of caring are handed down every year and that sixty of those sentenced are illegal immigrants who do not even understand the punishment due to the language barrier
one model was the concluding conference that was held on the first phase of plan d last december here not only the parliament the commission but also the committee of the regions and the european economic and social committee were involved
nor can we be content with improving the safety of tunnels that are part of the tens while taking no account of the other road tunnels
p t i asked a very specific question
yes in two thousand only our thirty four million have been committed to date following the reorientation of the helsinki programmer
must it be deduced that in certain subregions even while money is made available the economic numbness is such that there is no longer even the capacity to draw up projects to utilize it
i believe that we in the committee on agriculture and rural development have done an excellent job after listening to consultants and after listening to different professional groups we have tried to improve on the text that was given to us by the council and the commission making it more applicable and more consistent safeguarding what amounts to the expression of and the right to religious practices in all their facets
it is not enough to look each other straight in the eye and say we promise to obey all the rules
the european parliament also adopted my proposal to have the commission report annually to parliament and inform us of whether its forecasts that the resources set aside will be absorbed over the next three years prove accurate this report forms the basis for very close monitoring of this process and that is a positive thing from a wide variety of points of view
while we are focusing on the costs of the budget we must also focus more closely on those who really benefit from the unions policies and not only on the annual budgetary costs
we have a political and moral responsibility towards them but they also have one towards us particularly as regards human rights and freedom of expression as you pointed out commissioner
the commissions position on the monitor groups report is well known since it has expressed its views on each of the proposals contained in the report
when the committee of experts reported back it could only provide a majority report
she also forget that they can lie about their origins and languages and can destroy their papers and so on so as not to be reported
for this reason it is only right that we draw attention to the problem because there needs to be greater awareness of the fact that the failure to seriously combat undeclared work is liable to generate these problems and at the same time to greatly weaken social security schemes in europe in the near future
perhaps he will do so at a later date
we have so far managed to gain acceptance for our principles in international circles
lastly i suggested that from the budgetary point of view it would be preferable not to introduce submits for the two regions which limits flexibility instead the regulation should have an overall financial framework
at the same time the market should not harbor the misleading belief that risky investments will remain
we perhaps see it more from the outside than the inside but it is complementary to our basic personal national local regional dimensions it is enriching
in this context however i have to mention that a number of the amendments concern provisions of regulation e c no ten million, four hundred and ninety two thousand and one which the commission did not propose to amend
absolute account must be taken of the economic and social committee s reservations concerning strict limits on exemptions and harmonization of veterinary legislation
independence yes but independence in relation to what
regarding the mccartin report i want to put on record especially for people in the public gallery some of the simple facts which we should be talking about
the third area of discussion is illegal migration because to be comprehensive we must also tackle illegal migration and protect european external borders
i want to add support to what previous speakers have said about an immediate ceasefire
good presentation of information about the health benefits of the products being promoted and about the way the foods are produced is essential

in adopting this report we are successfully and promptly safeguarding continuing financial assistance for the transitional period next year two thousand and six pending approval of the new financial perspectives for actions which help to promote equality and incorporate it in all european union policies
this is extremely regrettable and remarkable considering that the eu s responsibility after kyoto is to reduce c o two emissions by a total of eight
italy as a founding member of the european union has always played its part and has always been willing to make sacrifices for the sake of the future
why is this because it responds to every new problem in the same way as the european council or the commission by setting up another new institution or another authority
thirdly we are concerned about the fact that keno is a bat without a ball there is no money being put forward to connect the two nuclear power stations into the north korean grid system

mr president regarding the matter of television friday morning sittings can you tell me whether they will be televised from now on
this is why the commission places a high value on their contribution to environmental policy and as we have seen parliament also shares this view
on twenty seven and twenty eight february twenty ten storm xynthia killed fifty three and injured around eighty in vendée and charentemaritime it was a genuinely traumatic experience for the region and the nation and its psychological and economic impact is still being felt ten months later
that conclusion is as clear as day the intergovernmental method without commitments that underpins the lisbon strategy does not work properly
there are many different ideas around and different experiences to draw upon not just in the european union
my group is still not convinced that the construction of two nuclear power stations in urine to replace the loss of capacity as a result of the closure of chernobyl is the least cost option economically speaking
of course it is a fact that these constitutional procedures are the very basis of our parliamentary democracies that is a fact but let us make it quite clear you really must act quickly
many of them decide to move to towns to look for work which in turn leads to an aging of the rural population a drop in the natural growth rate and a general deterioration of living conditions for residents of rural areas
do you wish to speak now or wait until the end
rather we think that it is precisely because of the dramatic nature of this situation that we must call for serious analyses both of this specific case and of the issue of waste in general which is not a concern only for naples and campagna but something every community has to tackle
a success too for our method and for the institutions the commission the council and parliament
it was almost ten years ago that the european union decided to enter into a partnership promoting development in the euromediterranean region the question of textiles therefore points more than ever to the need to establish a real freetrade area as soon as we can
the presence of both of us here is highly symbolic because it signals that the lisbon strategy is not based solely on economics and finance – although these clearly remain absolutely essential elements – but that crucial importance is also attached to its social and human dimensions
these were attributable to the risks inherent in the transactions themselves and the fact that the supervision and monitoring systems fail to limit the risk of irregularities with an acceptable degree of effectiveness
because we are fully aware of the possible risk of this our proposal includes the following strict requirements which incidentally go further than what is usually required for food additives
thirdly to facilitate greater access to the clean development mechanism by the poor countries of africa and other areas of the planet
however we believe that the report should have gone further in attributing responsibility to the eus agricultural policies and governments such as those in portugal because it is these policies that have encouraged overexploitation of soil and water and caused environmental damage
amendment no six aims chiefly to abolish the derogation from labeling provided for in the proposal for ingredients which make up preparations of sauces and mustards constituting less than five of the foodstuffs
in conclusion a few days ago the president of the european council mr van comply stated that europeans are not innovative because they are depressed
only one would never call it that today
from now on if we need to know how to grub up vines in certain fragile zones we should also know how to replant them taking into account the requirements and demand for quality
in two and a half years the legislation will come into force
only then can the eu obtain real influence
mr president ladies and gentlemen this kind of debate is of course always a chance to take a critical look at ourselves and see whether have done everything right in the past measured against our common aims
we can indeed be very proud of these five years and we shall certainly make even greater progress on this in future
the council expressed this in december two thousand and eight when it backed the rapid introduction by the european social fund of supplementary measures to support employment
it is true that if you want something done it is better to do it yourself and that the best way of doing it is simply to confuse the issue so that only a few insiders understand what is going on in this case the commission
the evaluation showed that further progress is to harmonies the acquire communautaire
if this is the path we choose to follow and if they do indeed rebalance payments to use commission terminology all other initiatives should receive the same treatment giving community vessel owners responsibilities in negotiating agreements especially bearing in mind that the commission does not always negotiate with the sectors interests at heart this is a sector let us remember which in the agreements to which we are referring here access to resources in return for financial compensation is already paying approximately one third of the total cost of the agreements
every settlement plan put forward in the past decade and a half of the yugoslav regions tragic history has been conceived in terms of peoples selfregulation of autonomies and of powersharing
the commission shares the concern for action and not just words in ensuring the coherence of the rules on human rights applied by the national courts and by the european court of human rights in strasbourg or the court of justice of the european communities
this is the line taken by the committee on regional policy in its contribution to the rural charter for although there is a shortage of basic services such as health and education in rural areas it cannot be tackled separately in each and every part of the rural world
this is particularly true of the period of the second world war and also of the most recent two decades
mr president i have not time in two minutes to talk in great detail about what we have done
strictly speaking this is not covered in this proposal as it forms part of separate legislation
twentyfive national plans are weakening our ability to grow together we need one outlook a more univocal outlook
you can set out your arguments in that forum
however as far as the implementation of the regulation is concerned some exceptions such as those proposed by the rapporteur have to be included
i therefore support mrs avilés areas report and hope that in the interim evaluation of the implementation of funds earmarked for two thousand and three will show evidence of the results of the equality policy and that the programming for twenty million, forty two thousand and six is improved with a view to achieving the following aim the structural funds must be a powerful weapon for improving equal opportunities for women in the european union
for ideological reasons that are only too familiar this approach is considered to be out of the question instead efforts are made to handle the problems created by the drugs traffic from an economic angle and even to establish research credits although the efficacy of such credits is not really proven
the new countries have come through the preparatory stage with flying colors
while expressing our solidarity with the people of the congo we refuse to be associated in any way whatsoever with the representatives of the political powers which bear some of the responsibility for the past and present oppression of this country some of whom still belong to political or business networks whose goal is to make profits on the back of africa
we need much stronger measures to combat this scourge and my party the british conservatives will even accept the appointment of a counterterrorist coordinator if this can be shown to improve security
we have no time for the argument that members could not then change their minds
on this point at least we are in agreement with mr nordmann i do not understand the commissioners reply very well
i think there is no doubt that we have to see our relationship with the atlantic alliance in that context at the moment that institution forms part of the framework of security in europe as we all know but it should not be the only institution involved in that security
mr president before i go further i would just like to pay tribute to the rapporteur mrs morgan
mr president the rapporteur and the piece voting list objected to the liberal proposal to insert the subheading

we need to support this effort
i shall draw the following conclusions firstly as regards the laissezfaire approach and the lack of regulation bearing in mind the reserve that comes with my job i think i have expressed myself quite clearly
however we believe parliaments proposals are serious and credible which is why we do not agree with the council amendments which fail to include them
i wonder whether the commission is prepared to support a new initiative on these lines or to develop it from scratch since cases of this kind are now making much more headway through the court of justice
furthermore with the stagnant situation in africa europe is more and more intimidated by flows of immigration that might become strenuous to the welfare state
it was chancellor merely from two thousand and seven i think and i can find no trace of it
today is a dark day for those of us who want pithy and effective european cooperation but above all it is a very dark day for recreational fishermen in all member states

emergency is never the best counsel and you mentioned that you would study the potential proposal for making such a mechanism permanent
mr president i should like to say that i am very unhappy with the commissions reply

time and again i hear from my constituents that the european union does nothing for them
european farmers are already making efforts to supply safe products using techniques that respect the environment and animal welfare
firstly there is typeapproval
that would be very unfortunate
amendment no eleven second part cannot be accepted because a member state cannot establish a transitional period
your words which have stressed the importance of languages as a factor of culture are without doubt a very important aspect and i can assure you that your speech was music to the ears of everyone here one of your best songs
famine must be averted through social remedies as well as political and economic ones
although that aspect has meanwhile been removed from the directive it has been revived by the rapporteur
therefore it is essential that the guidelines are clear and agreed at european level
el madam president i thank the minister for repeating all the measures envisaged under the structural funds and the european social fund
i agree that a qualified majority vote is better than disqualified unanimity

the time to assess the way in which the member states have used european aid will be when any new aid is granted and it is then that we will perhaps be able to draw conclusions from measures that were unsuitable particularly in the social sphere
against this background we have followed with some concern the calls for the unification of the eu with the we
in other words do we choose stagnation or progress
this theme does not break any new ground as it has after all been compulsory for almost fifty years and it cannot fail to cause us concern because more europe equate to nothing more than the constantly increasing destruction of what makes up the substance of europe namely the nations
it is not true that we show solidarity no
the european parliament democratically elected and accountable to the peoples of europe must affirm the right of asylum seekers to a dignified reception
the third word is effectiveness if we continue to water down the content of our proposals we will arrive at the lowest common denominator and we know what that is

a legal framework ensuring patent protection in this area is of key importance in enabling european industries including small and mediumsized enterprises to be competitive in a hightech environment
the committee on fisheries heard an account of this just a few months ago
for this reason i believe it would be useful prior to the adoption of a piece of legislation to be able to assess the sustainability impact of all eu expenditure under the bill in question
hence my tabling with my colleague mrs foster of two amendments which reflect the need for these problems to be resolved
the result of those elections has not been respected the military regime is still holding on to power thanks to the state of emergency
the second very important issue was how to secure appropriate financial accountability

part three of the preamble to this amendment concerns an external source of protection
this is a chance we should take
the financial crisis the world of the financial markets turns much faster than the council has reacted up to now

shortly afterwards the european council in nice took note of the commissions intention to analyse the supply of and demand for oilseed and proteinbearing crops in strict compliance with the financial perspective

ladies and gentlemen commissioner the increase in relocations by multinationals involving the partial or total closure of their factories in the countries of the eu in which they have been based especially portugal is aggravating unemployment stifling the development of regions lacking alternative forms of employment and increasing poverty and social exclusion
it is a main issue but the public perception is not always there the belief is that we have this silver bullet which will change everything
it was also the joint wish of the informal council of ministers in leipzig that the slovenian presidency should put the territorial agenda on the agenda for this years spring summit in order to achieve greater political recognition of the territorial framework for the development of regions and cities and new forms of participation in the eus political decisions

the commissions framework directive has provided for a method of living airport charges but gives member states enough room for movement too
the first is that as chairman of the delegation for relations with albania bona and herzegovina and sera and montenegro including kosovo i am delighted that the military mission – which is still necessary – is now in european hands and backing up the great financial and civilian commitment under the leadership of commissioner patten
what i mean is that we do not want any oenological methods that take us in the direction of cocacola we want the future of designations of origin and geographical indications to be secured

among other things it clarifies the significant amount of emissions which are emitted from the livestock sector it also emphasises the importance of relevant support to developing countries in their prevention and mitigation work to limit the negative effects of climate change
that is why we should use benchmarking
as it turned out such a requirement from the european commission did not exist however mr günter verheugen lied to the bulgarian parliament and said that there was such a requirement
